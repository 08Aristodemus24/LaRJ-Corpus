National laws or regulations shall provide for such supervisory measures as are necessary, either to prevent abuses in connection with the renewal of appliances, or to ensure that the additional compensation is utilised for this purpose.Article 11The national laws or regulations shall make such provision as, having regard to national circumstances, is deemed most suitable for ensuring in all circumstances, in the event of the insolvency of the employer or insurer, the payment of compensation to workmen who suffer personal injury due to industrial accidents, or, in case of death, to their dependants.Article 12The formal ratifications of this Convention, under the conditions set forth in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 131.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Thirty-second Session on 8 June 1949, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals concerning the protection of wages, which is the seventh item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this first day of July of the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-nine the following Convention, which may be cited as the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949:Article 1In this Convention, the term wages means remuneration or earnings, however designated or calculated, capable of being expressed in terms of money and fixed by mutual agreement or by national laws or regulations, which are payable in virtue of a written or unwritten contract of employment by an employer to an employed person for work done or to be done or for services rendered or to be rendered.Article 21. This Convention applies to all persons to whom wages are paid or payable.2. The competent authority may, after consultation with the organisations of employers and employed persons directly concerned, if such exist, exclude from the application of all or any of the provisions of the Convention categories of persons whose circumstances and conditions of employment are such that the application to them of all or any of the said provisions would be inappropriate and who are not employed in manual labour or are employed in domestic service or work similar thereto.3. Each Member shall indicate in its first annual report upon the application of this Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any categories of persons which it proposes to exclude from the application of all or any of the provisions of the Convention in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph; no Member shall, after the date of its first annual report, make exclusions except in respect of categories of persons so indicated.4. Each Member having indicated in its first annual report categories of persons which it proposes to exclude from the application of all or any of the provisions of the Convention shall indicate in subsequent annual reports any categories of persons in respect of which it renounces the right to have recourse to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article and any progress which may have been made with a view to the application of the Convention to such categories of persons.Article 31. Wages payable in money shall be paid only in legal tender, and payment in the form of promissory notes, vouchers or coupons, or in any other form alleged to represent legal tender, shall be prohibited.2. The competent authority may permit or prescribe the payment of wages by bank cheque or postal cheque or money order in cases in which payment in this manner is customary or is necessary because of special circumstances, or where a collective agreement or arbitration award so provides, or, where not so provided, with the consent of the worker concerned.Article 41. National laws or regulations, collective agreements or arbitration awards may authorise the partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind in industries or occupations in which payment in the form of such allowances is customary or desirable because of the nature of the industry or occupation concerned; the payment of wages in the form of liquor of high alcoholic content or of noxious drugs shall not be permitted in any circumstances.2. In cases in which partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind is authorised, appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) such allowances are appropriate for the personal use and benefit of the worker and his family; and(b) the value attributed to such allowances is fair and reasonable.Article 5Wages shall be paid directly to the worker concerned except as may be otherwise provided by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award or where the worker concerned has agreed to the contrary.Article 6Employers shall be prohibited from limiting in any manner the freedom of the worker to dispose of his wages.Article 71. Where works stores for the sale of commodities to the workers are established or services are operated in connection with an undertaking, the workers concerned shall be free from any coercion to make use of such stores or services.2. Where access to other stores or services is not possible, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures with the object of ensuring that goods are sold and services provided at fair and reasonable prices, or that stores established and services operated by the employer are not operated for the purpose of securing a profit but for the benefit of the workers concerned.Article 81. Deductions from wages shall be permitted only under conditions and to the extent prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Workers shall be informed, in the manner deemed most appropriate by the competent authority, of the conditions under which and the extent to which such deductions may be made.Article 9Any deduction from wages with a view to ensuring a direct or indirect payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining employment, made by a worker to an employer or his representative or to any intermediary (such as a labour contractor or recruiter), shall be prohibited.Article 101. Wages may be attached or assigned only in a manner and within limits prescribed by national laws or regulations.2. Wages shall be protected against attachment or assignment to the extent deemed necessary for the maintenance of the worker and his family.Article 111. In the event of the bankruptcy or judicial liquidation of an undertaking, the workers employed therein shall be treated as privileged creditors either as regards wages due to them for service rendered during such a period prior to the bankruptcy or judicial liquidation as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations, or as regards wages up to a prescribed amount as may be determined by national laws or regulations.2. Wages constituting a privileged debt shall be paid in full before ordinary creditors may establish any claim to a share of the assets.3. The relative priority of wages constituting a privileged debt and other privileged debts shall be determined by national laws or regulations.Article 121. Wages shall be paid regularly. Except where other appropriate arrangements exist which ensure the payment of wages at regular intervals, the intervals for the payment of wages shall be prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Upon the termination of a contract of employment, a final settlement of all wages due shall be effected in accordance with national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award or, in the absence of any applicable law, regulation, agreement or award, within a reasonable period of time having regard to the terms of the contract.Article 131. The payment of wages where made in cash shall be made on working days only and at or near the workplace, except as may be otherwise provided by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award, or where other arrangements known to the workers concerned are considered more appropriate.2. Payment of wages in taverns or other similar establishments and, where necessary to prevent abuse, in shops or stores for the retail sale of merchandise and in places of amusement shall be prohibited except in the case of persons employed therein.Article 14Where necessary, effective measures shall be taken to ensure that workers are informed, in an appropriate and easily understandable manner--(a) before they enter employment and when any changes take place, of the conditions in respect of wages under which they are employed; and(b) at the time of each payment of wages, of the particulars of their wages for the pay period concerned, in so far as such particulars may be subject to change.Article 15The laws or regulations giving effect to the provisions of this Convention shall--(a) be made available for the information of persons concerned;(b) define the persons responsible for compliance therewith;(c) prescribe adequate penalties or other appropriate remedies for any violation thereof;(d) provide for the maintenance, in all appropriate cases, of adequate records in an approved form and manner.Article 16There shall be included in the annual reports to be submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation full information concerning the measures by which effect is given to the provisions of this Convention.Article 171. In the case of a Member the territory of which includes large areas where, by reason of the sparseness of the population or the stage of development of the area, the competent authority considers it impracticable to enforce the provisions of this Convention, the authority may, after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, exempt such areas from the application of this Convention either generally or with such exceptions in respect of particular undertakings or occupations as it thinks fit.2. Each Member shall indicate in its first annual report upon the application of this Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any areas in respect of which it proposes to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article and shall give the reasons for which it proposes to have recourse thereto; no Member shall, after the date of its first annual report, have recourse to the provisions of the present Article except in respect of areas so indicated.3. Each Member having recourse to the provisions of this Article shall, at intervals not exceeding three years, reconsider in consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, the practicability of extending the application of the Convention to areas exempted in virtue of paragraph 1.4. Each Member having recourse to the provisions of this Article shall indicate in subsequent annual reports any areas in respect of which it renounces the right to have recourse to the provisions of this Article and any progress which may have been made with a view to the progressive application of the Convention in such areas.Article 18The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 191.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Forty-second Session on 4 June 1958, andHaving considered the question of conditions of employment of plantation workers, which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving decided that, as an exceptional measure, in order to expedite the application to plantations of certain provisions of existing Conventions, pending the more general ratification of these Conventions and the application of their provisions to all persons within their scope, and to provide for the application to plantations of certain Conventions not at present applicable thereto, it is desirable to adopt an instrument for these purposes, andHaving determined that this instrument shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-fourth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight the following Convention, which may be cited as the Plantations Convention, 1958:PART I.

For the purpose of this Article the term plantation shall ordinarily include services carrying out the primary processing of the product or products of the plantation.Article 2Each Member which ratifies this Convention undertakes to apply its provisions equally to all plantation workers without distinction as to race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, nationality, social origin, tribe or trade union membership.Article 31. Each Member for which this Convention is in force--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) shall comply with--\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t(i) Part I;(ii) Parts IV, IX and XI;(iii) at least two of Parts II, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XII and XIII; and(iv) Part XIV;(b) shall, if it has excluded one or more Parts from its acceptance of the obligations of the Convention, specify, in a declaration appended to its ratification, the Part or Parts so excluded.2. Each Member which has made a declaration under paragraph 1 (b) of this Article shall indicate in its annual reports submitted under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any progress made towards the application of the excluded Part or Parts.3. Each Member which has ratified the Convention, but has excluded any Part or Parts thereof under the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, may subsequently notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office that it accepts the obligations of the Convention in respect of any Part or Parts so excluded; such undertakings shall be deemed to be an integral part of the ratification and to have the force of ratification as from the date of notification.Article 4In accordance with Article 19, paragraph 8, of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, nothing in this Convention shall affect any law, award, custom or agreement which ensures more favourable conditions to the workers concerned than those provided for by the Convention.PART II. ENGAGEMENT AND RECRUITMENT OF MIGRANT WORKERSArticle 5For the purposes of this Part of this Convention the term recruiting includes all operations undertaken with the object of obtaining or supplying the labour of persons who do not spontaneously offer their services at the place of employment or at a public emigration or employment office or at an office conducted by an employers' organisation and supervised by the competent authority.Article 6The recruiting of the head of a family shall not be deemed to involve the recruiting of any member of his family.Article 7No person or association shall engage in professional recruiting unless the said person or association has been licensed by the competent authority and is recruiting workers for a public department or for one or more specific employers or organisations of employers.Article 8Employers, employers' agents, organisations of employers, organisations subsidised by employers, and the agents of organisations of employers and of organisations subsidised by employers shall only engage in recruiting if licensed by the competent authority.Article 91. Recruited workers shall be brought before a public officer, who shall satisfy himself that the law and regulations concerning recruiting have been observed and, in particular, that the workers have not been subjected to illegal pressure or recruited by misrepresentation or mistake.2. Recruited workers shall be brought before such an officer as near as may be convenient to the place of recruiting or, in the case of workers recruited in one territory for employment in a territory under a different administration, at latest at the place of departure from the territory of recruiting.Article 10Where the circumstances make the adoption of such a provision practicable and necessary, the competent authority shall require the issue to each recruited worker who is not engaged at or near the place of recruiting of a document in writing such as a memorandum of information, a work book or a provisional contract containing such particulars as the authority may prescribe, as for example particulars of the identity of the workers, the prospective conditions of employment, and any advances of wages made to the workers.Article 111. Every recruited worker shall be medically examined.2. Where the worker has been recruited for employment at a distance from the place of recruiting, or has been recruited in one territory for employment in a territory under a different administration, the medical examination shall take place as near as may be convenient to the place of recruiting or, in the case of workers recruited in one territory for employment in a territory under a different administration, at latest at the place of departure from the territory of recruiting.3. The competent authority may empower public officers before whom workers are brought in pursuance of Article 9 to authorise the departure prior to medical examination of workers in whose case they are satisfied--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) that it was and is impossible for the medical examination to take place near to the place of recruiting or at the place of departure;(b) that the worker is fit for the journey and the prospective employment; and (c) that the worker will be medically examined on arrival at the place of employment or as soon as possible thereafter.4. The competent authority may, particularly when the journey of the recruited workers is of such duration and takes place under such conditions that the health of the workers is likely to be affected, require recruited workers to be examined both before departure and after arrival at the place of employment.5. The competent authority shall ensure that all necessary measures are taken for the acclimatisation and adaptation of recruited workers and for their immunisation against disease.Article 121. The recruiter or employer shall whenever possible provide transport to the place of employment for recruited workers.2. The competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) that the vehicles or vessels used for the transport of workers are suitable for such transport, are in good sanitary condition and are not overcrowded;(b) that when it is necessary to break the journey for the night suitable accommodation is provided for the workers; and(c) that in the case of long journeys all necessary arrangements are made for medical assistance and for the welfare of the workers.3. When recruited workers have to make long journeys on foot to the place of employment the competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) that the length of the daily journey is compatible with the maintenance of the health and strength of the workers; and(b) that, where the extent of the movement of labour makes this necessary, rest camps or rest houses are provided at suitable points on main routes and are kept in proper sanitary condition and have the necessary facilities for medical attention.4. When recruited workers have to make long journeys in groups to the place of employment, they shall be convoyed by a responsible person.Article 131. The expenses of the journey of recruited workers to the place of employment, including all expenses incurred for their protection during the journey, shall be borne by the recruiter or employer.2. The recruiter or employer shall furnish recruited workers with everything necessary for their welfare during the journey to the place of employment, including particularly, as local circumstances may require, adequate and suitable supplies of food, drinking water, fuel and cooking utensils, clothing and blankets.Article 14Any recruited worker who--(a) becomes incapacitated by sickness or accident during the journey to the place of employment,(b) is found on medical examination to be unfit for employment,(c) is not engaged after recruiting for a reason for which he is not responsible, or(d) is found by the competent authority to have been recruited by misrepresentation or mistake,shall be repatriated at the expense of the recruiter or employer.Article 15Where the families of recruited workers have been authorised to accompany the workers to the place of employment the competent authority shall take all necessary measures for safeguarding their health and welfare during the journey and more particularly--(a) Articles 12 and 13 of this Convention shall apply to such families;(b) in the event of the worker being repatriated in virtue of Article 14, his family shall also be repatriated; and(c) in the event of the death of the worker during the journey to the place of employment, his family shall be repatriated.Article 16The competent authority shall limit the amount which may be paid to recruited workers in respect of advances of wages and shall regulate the conditions under which such advances may be made.Article 171. Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force undertakes that it will, so far as national laws and regulations permit, take all appropriate steps against misleading propaganda relating to emigration and immigration.2. For this purpose it will, where appropriate, act in co-operation with other Members concerned.Article 18Measures shall be taken as appropriate by each Member, within its jurisdiction, to facilitate the departure, journey and reception of migrants for employment on a plantation.Article 19Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force undertakes to maintain, within its jurisdiction, appropriate medical services responsible for--(a) ascertaining, where necessary, both at the time of departure and on arrival, that migrants for employment on a plantation and the members of their families authorised to accompany or join them are in reasonable health;(b) ensuring that migrants for employment on a plantation and members of their families enjoy adequate medical attention and good hygienic conditions at the time of departure, during the journey and on arrival in the territory of destination.PART III. CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT AND ABOLITION OF PENAL SANCTIONSArticle 201. The law and/or regulations in force in the territory concerned shall prescribe the maximum period of service which may be stipulated or implied in any contract, whether written or oral.2. The maximum period of service which may be stipulated or implied in any contract for employment not involving a long and expensive journey shall in no case exceed 12 months if the workers are not accompanied by their families or two years if the workers are accompanied by their families.3. The maximum period of service which may be stipulated or implied in any contract for employment involving a long and expensive journey shall in no case exceed two years if the workers are not accompanied by their families or three years if the workers are accompanied by their families.4. The competent authority may, after consultation with the employers' and workers' organisations representative of the interests concerned, where such exist, exclude from the application of this Part of this Convention contracts entered into between employers and non-manual workers whose freedom of choice in employment is satisfactorily safeguarded; such exclusion may apply to all plantation workers in a territory, to plantation workers engaged in the production of a particular crop, to the workers in any specified undertaking or to special groups of plantation workers.Article 21The competent authority in each country where there exists any penal sanction for any breach of a contract of employment by a plantation worker shall take action for the abolition of all such penal sanctions.Article 22Such action shall provide for the abolition of all such penal sanctions by means of an appropriate measure of immediate application.Article 23For the purpose of this Part of the Convention the term breach of contract means--(a) any refusal or failure of the worker to commence or perform the service stipulated in the contract;(b) any neglect of duty or lack of diligence on the part of the worker;(c) the absence of the worker without permission or valid reason; and(d) the desertion of the worker.PART IV. WAGESArticle 241. The fixing of minimum wages by collective agreements freely negotiated between trade unions which are representative of the workers concerned and employers or employers' organisations shall be encouraged.2. Where no adequate arrangements exist for the fixing of minimum wages by collective agreement, the necessary arrangements shall be made whereby minimum rates of wages can be fixed, where appropriate by means of national laws or regulations, in consultation with representatives of the employers and workers, including representatives of their respective organisations, where such exist, such consultation to be on a basis of complete equality.3. Minimum rates of wages which have been fixed in accordance with arrangements made in pursuance of the preceding paragraph shall be binding on the employers and workers concerned so as not to be subject to abatement.Article 251. Each Member for which this Convention is in force shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the employers and workers concerned are informed of the minimum rates of wages in force and that wages are not paid at less than these rates in cases where they are applicable; these measures shall include such provision for supervision, inspection, and sanctions as may be necessary and appropriate to the conditions obtaining on plantations in the country concerned.2. A worker to whom the minimum rates are applicable and who has been paid wages at less than these rates shall be entitled to recover, by judicial or other appropriate proceedings, the amount by which he has been underpaid, subject to such limitations of time as may be determined by national laws or regulations.Article 26Wages payable in money shall be paid only in legal tender, and payment in the form of promissory notes, vouchers or coupons, or in any other form alleged to represent legal tender, shall be prohibited.Article 271. National laws or regulations, collective agreements or arbitration awards may authorise the partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind where payment in the form of such allowances is customary or desirable; the payment of wages in the form of liquor of high alcoholic content or of noxious drugs shall not be permitted in any circumstances.2. In cases in which partial payment of wages in the form of allowances in kind is authorised, appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that such allowances are appropriate for the personal use and benefit of the worker and his family.3. Where food, housing, clothing and other essential supplies and services form part of remuneration, all practicable steps shall be taken to ensure that they are adequate and their cash value properly assessed.Article 28Wages shall be paid directly to the worker concerned except as may be otherwise provided by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award or where the worker concerned has agreed to the contrary.Article 29Employers shall be prohibited from limiting in any manner the freedom of the worker to dispose of his wages.Article 301. Where works stores for the sale of commodities to the workers are established or services are operated in connection with an undertaking, the workers concerned shall be free from any coercion to make use of such stores or services.2. Where access to other stores or services is not possible, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures with the object of ensuring that goods are sold and services provided at fair and reasonable prices, or that stores established and services operated by the employer are not operated for the purpose of securing a profit but for the benefit of the workers concerned.Article 311. Deductions from wages shall be permitted only under conditions and to the extent prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Workers shall be informed, in the manner deemed most appropriate by the competent authority, of the conditions under which and the extent to which such deductions may be made.Article 32Any deduction from wages with a view to ensuring a direct or indirect payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining employment, made by a worker to an employer or his representative or to any intermediary (such as a labour contractor or recruiter), shall be prohibited.Article 331. Wages shall be paid regularly. Except where other appropriate arrangements exist which ensure the payment of wages at regular intervals, the intervals for the payment of wages shall be prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award.2. Upon the termination of a contract of employment, a final settlement of all wages due shall be effected in accordance with national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award or, in the absence of any applicable law, regulation, agreement or award, within a reasonable period of time having regard to the terms of the contract.Article 34Where necessary, effective measures shall be taken to ensure that workers are informed, in an appropriate and easily understandable manner--(a) before they enter employment and when any changes take place, of the conditions in respect of wages under which they are employed; and(b) at the time of each payment of wages, of the particulars of their wages for the pay period concerned, in so far as such particulars may be subject to change.Article 35The laws or regulations giving effect to the provisions of Articles 26 to 34 of this Convention shall--(a) be made available for the information of persons concerned;(b) define the persons responsible for compliance therewith;(c) prescribe adequate penalties or other appropriate remedies for any violation thereof;(d) provide for the maintenance, in all appropriate cases, of adequate records in an approved form and manner.PART V.

Each Member for which this Part of this Convention is in force shall be free to decide the manner in which provision shall be made for holidays with pay on plantations.2. Such provision may be made, where appropriate, by means of collective agreement or by entrusting the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations to special bodies.3. Wherever the manner in which provision is made for holidays with pay on plantations permits--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) there shall be full preliminary consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, and with any other persons, specially qualified by their trade or functions, whom the competent authority deems it useful to consult;(b) the employers and workers concerned shall participate in the regulation of holidays with pay, or be consulted or have the right to be heard, in such manner and to such extent as may be determined by national laws or regulations, but in any case on a basis of complete equality.Article 38The required minimum period of continuous service and the minimum duration of the annual holiday with pay shall be determined by national laws or regulations, collective agreement or arbitration award, or by special bodies entrusted with the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations, or in any other manner approved by the competent authority.Article 39Where appropriate, provision shall be made, in accordance with the established procedure for the regulation of holidays with pay on plantations, for--(a) more favourable treatment for young workers, in cases in which the annual holiday with pay granted to adult workers is not considered adequate for young workers;(b) an increase in the duration of the annual paid holiday with the length of service;(c) proportionate holidays or payment in lieu thereof, in cases where the period of continuous service of a worker is not of sufficient duration to qualify him for an annual holiday with pay but exceeds such minimum period as may be determined in accordance with the established procedure;(d) the exclusion from the annual holiday with pay of public and customary holidays and weekly rest periods, and, to such extent as may be determined in accordance with the established procedure, temporary interruptions of attendance at work due to such causes as sickness or accident.Article 401.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Sixtieth Session on 4 June 1975, andRecognising that the importance of rural workers in the world makes it urgent to associate them with economic and social development action if their conditions of work and life are to be permanently and effectively improved, andNoting that in many countries of the world and particularly in developing countries there is massive under-utilisation of land and labour and that this makes it imperative for rural workers to be given every encouragement to develop free and viable organisations capable of protecting and furthering the interests of their members and ensuring their effective contribution to economic and social development, andConsidering that such organisations can and should contribute to the alleviation of the persistent scarcity of food products in various regions of the world, andRecognising that land reform is in many developing countries an essential factor in the improvement of the conditions of work and life of rural workers and that organisations of such workers should accordingly co-operate and participate actively in the implementation of such reform, andRecalling the terms of existing international labour Conventions and Recommendations--in particular the Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, 1921, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948, and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949--which affirm the right of all workers, including rural workers, to establish free and independent organisations, and the provisions of numerous international labour Conventions and Recommendations applicable to rural workers which call for the participation, inter alia, of workers' organisations in their implementation, andNoting the joint concern of the United Nations and the specialised agencies, in particular the International Labour Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, with land reform and rural development, andNoting that the following standards have been framed in co-operation with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and that, with a view to avoiding duplication, there will be continuing co-operation with that Organisation and with the United Nations in promoting and securing the application of these standards, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to organisations of rural workers and their role in economic and social development, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention, 1975:Article 1This Convention applies to all types of organisations of rural workers, including organisations not restricted to but representative of rural workers.Article 21. For the purposes of this Convention, the term rural workers means any person engaged in agriculture, handicrafts or a related occupation in a rural area, whether as a wage earner or, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, as a self-employed person such as a tenant, sharecropper or small owner-occupier.2. This Convention applies only to those tenants, sharecroppers or small owner-occupiers who derive their main income from agriculture, who work the land themselves, with the help only of their family or with the help of occasional outside labour and who do not--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) permanently employ workers; or(b) employ a substantial number of seasonal workers; or(c) have any land cultivated by sharecroppers or tenants.Article 31.

The principles of freedom of association shall be fully respected; rural workers' organisations shall be independent and voluntary in character and shall remain free from all interference, coercion or repression.3. The acquisition of legal personality by organisations of rural workers shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article.4. In exercising the rights provided for in this Article rural workers and their respective organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.5. The law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Article.Article 4It shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination as defined in the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.Article 51. In order to enable organisations of rural workers to play their role in economic and social development, each Member which ratifies this Convention shall adopt and carry out a policy of active encouragement to these organisations, particularly with a view to eliminating obstacles to their establishment, their growth and the pursuit of their lawful activities, as well as such legislative and administrative discrimination against rural workers' organisations and their members as may exist.2. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall ensure that national laws or regulations do not, given the special circumstances of the rural sector, inhibit the establishment and growth of rural workers' organisations.Article 6Steps shall be taken to promote the widest possible understanding of the need to further the development of rural workers' organisations and of the contribution they can make to improving employment opportunities and general conditions of work and life in rural areas as well as to increasing the national income and achieving a better distribution thereof.Article 7The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 81. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2.

Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not, within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in this Article, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms provided for in this Article.Article 101. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall notify all Members of the International Labour Organisation of the registration of all ratifications and denunciations communicated to him by the Members of the Organisation.2. When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 11The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding Articles.Article 12At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 131.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Sixtieth Session on 4 June 1975, andConsidering that the Preamble of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation assigns to it the task of protecting \"the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own\", andConsidering that the Declaration of Philadelphia reaffirms, among the principles on which the Organisation is based, that \"labour is not a commodity\", and that \"poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere\", and recognises the solemn obligation of the ILO to further programmes which will achieve in particular full employment through \"the transfer of labour, including for employment ...\",Considering the ILO World Employment Programme and the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, and emphasising the need to avoid the excessive and uncontrolled or unassisted increase of migratory movements because of their negative social and human consequences, andConsidering that in order to overcome underdevelopment and structural and chronic unemployment, the governments of many countries increasingly stress the desirability of encouraging the transfer of capital and technology rather than the transfer of workers in accordance with the needs and requests of these countries in the reciprocal interest of the countries of origin and the countries of employment, andConsidering the right of everyone to leave any country, including his own, and to enter his own country, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, andRecalling the provisions contained in the Migration for Employment Convention and Recommendation (Revised), 1949, in the Protection of Migrant Workers (Underdeveloped Countries) Recommendation, 1955, in the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, in the Employment Service Convention and Recommendation, 1948, and in the Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (Revised), 1949, which deal with such matters as the regulation of the recruitment, introduction and placing of migrant workers, the provision of accurate information relating to migration, the minimum conditions to be enjoyed by migrants in transit and on arrival, the adoption of an active employment policy and international collaboration in these matters, andConsidering that the migration of workers due to conditions in labour markets should take place under the responsibility of official agencies for employment or in accordance with the relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements, in particular those permitting free circulation of workers, andConsidering that evidence of the existence of illicit and clandestine trafficking in labour calls for further standards specifically aimed at eliminating these abuses, andRecalling the provisions of the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949, which require ratifying Members to apply to immigrants lawfully within their territory treatment not less favourable than that which they apply to their nationals in respect of a variety of matters which it enumerates, in so far as these are regulated by laws or regulations or subject to the control of administrative authorities, andRecalling that the definition of the term \"discrimination\" in the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958, does not mandatorily include distinctions on the basis of nationality, andConsidering that further standards, covering also social security, are desirable in order to promote equality of opportunity and treatment of migrant workers and, with regard to matters regulated by laws or regulations or subject to the control of administrative authorities, ensure treatment at least equal to that of nationals, andNoting that, for the full success of action regarding the very varied problems of migrant workers, it is essential that there be close co-operation with the United Nations and other specialised agencies, andNoting that, in the framing of the following standards, account has been taken of the work of the United Nations and of other specialised agencies and that, with a view to avoiding duplication and to ensuring appropriate co-ordination, there will be continuing co-operation in promoting and securing the application of the standards, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to migrant workers, which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention supplementing the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949, and the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958,adopts this twenty-fourth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975:PART I. MIGRATIONS IN ABUSIVE CONDITIONSArticle 1Each Member for which this Convention is in force undertakes to respect the basic human rights of all migrant workers.Article 21. Each Member for which this Convention is in force shall systematically seek to determine whether there are illegally employed migrant workers on its territory and whether there depart from, pass through or arrive in its territory any movements of migrants for employment in which the migrants are subjected during their journey, on arrival or during their period of residence and employment to conditions contravening relevant international multilateral or bilateral instruments or agreements, or national laws or regulations.2. The representative organisations of employers and workers shall be fully consulted and enabled to furnish any information in their possession on this subject.Article 3Each Member shall adopt all necessary and appropriate measures, both within its jurisdiction and in collaboration with other Members--(a) to suppress clandestine movements of migrants for employment and illegal employment of migrants, and(b) against the organisers of illicit or clandestine movements of migrants for employment departing from, passing through or arriving in its territory, and against those who employ workers who have immigrated in illegal conditions,in order to prevent and to eliminate the abuses referred to in Article 2 of this Convention.Article 4In particular, Members shall take such measures as are necessary, at the national and the international level, for systematic contact and exchange of information on the subject with other States, in consultation with representative organisations of employers and workers.Article 5One of the purposes of the measures taken under Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention shall be that the authors of manpower trafficking can be prosecuted whatever the country from which they exercise their activities.Article 61. Provision shall be made under national laws or regulations for the effective detection of the illegal employment of migrant workers and for the definition and the application of administrative, civil and penal sanctions, which include imprisonment in their range, in respect of the illegal employment of migrant workers, in respect of the organisation of movements of migrants for employment defined as involving the abuses referred to in Article 2 of this Convention, and in respect of knowing assistance to such movements, whether for profit or otherwise.2. Where an employer is prosecuted by virtue of the provision made in pursuance of this Article, he shall have the right to furnish proof of his good faith.Article 7The representative organisations of employers and workers shall be consulted in regard to the laws and regulations and other measures provided for in this Convention and designed to prevent and eliminate the abuses referred to above, and the possibility of their taking initiatives for this purpose shall be recognised.Article 81. On condition that he has resided legally in the territory for the purpose of employment, the migrant worker shall not be regarded as in an illegal or irregular situation by the mere fact of the loss of his employment, which shall not in itself imply the withdrawal of his authorisation of residence or, as the case may be, work permit.2. Accordingly, he shall enjoy equality of treatment with nationals in respect in particular of guarantees of security of employment, the provision of alternative employment, relief work and retraining.Article 91. Without prejudice to measures designed to control movements of migrants for employment by ensuring that migrant workers enter national territory and are admitted to employment in conformity with the relevant laws and regulations, the migrant worker shall, in cases in which these laws and regulations have not been respected and in which his position cannot be regularised, enjoy equality of treatment for himself and his family in respect of rights arising out of past employment as regards remuneration, social security and other benefits.2. In case of dispute about the rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, the worker shall have the possibility of presenting his case to a competent body, either himself or through a representative.3. In case of expulsion of the worker or his family, the cost shall not be borne by them.4. Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Members from giving persons who are illegally residing or working within the country the right to stay and to take up legal employment.PART II.

A Member may take all necessary measures which fall within its competence and collaborate with other Members to facilitate the reunification of the families of all migrant workers legally residing in its territory.2. The members of the family of the migrant worker to which this Article applies are the spouse and dependent children, father and mother.Article 14A Member may--(a) make the free choice of employment, while assuring migrant workers the right to geographical mobility, subject to the conditions that the migrant worker has resided lawfully in its territory for the purpose of employment for a prescribed period not exceeding two years or, if its laws or regulations provide for contracts for a fixed term of less than two years, that the worker has completed his first work contract;(b) after appropriate consultation with the representative organisations of employers and workers, make regulations concerning recognition of occupational qualifications acquired outside its territory, including certificates and diplomas;(c) restrict access to limited categories of employment or functions where this is necessary in the interests of the State.PART III FINAL PROVISIONSArticle 15This Convention does not prevent Members from concluding multilateral or bilateral agreements with a view to resolving problems arising from its application.Article 161. Any Member which ratifies this Convention may, by a declaration appended to its ratification, exclude either Part I or Part II from its acceptance of the Convention.2. Any Member which has made such a declaration may at any time cancel that declaration by a subsequent declaration.3.

For the purpose of this Convention, the term nursing personnel includes all categories of persons providing nursing care and nursing services.2. This Convention applies to all nursing personnel, wherever they work.3. The competent authority may, after consultation with the employers' and workers' organisations concerned, where such organisations exist, establish special rules concerning nursing personnel who give nursing care and services on a voluntary basis; these rules shall not derogate from the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 2 (a), Article 3, Article 4 and Article 7 of this Convention.Article 21. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall adopt and apply, in a manner appropriate to national conditions, a policy concerning nursing services and nursing personnel designed, within the framework of a general health programme, where such a programme exists, and within the resources available for health care as a whole, to provide the quantity and quality of nursing care necessary for attaining the highest possible level of health for the population.2.

Where necessary, in addition to the above enumeration, each Member may define the line of division which separates industry from commerce and agriculture.Article 21. The whole of the staff employed in any industrial undertaking, public or private, or in any branch thereof shall, except as otherwise provided for by the following Articles, enjoy in every period of seven days a period of rest comprising at least twenty-four consecutive hours.2. This period of rest shall, wherever possible, be granted simultaneously to the whole of the staff of each undertaking.3. It shall, wherever possible, be fixed so as to coincide with the days already established by the traditions or customs of the country or district.Article 3Each Member may except from the application of the provisions of Article 2 persons employed in industrial undertakings in which only the members of one single family are employed.Article 41. Each Member may authorise total or partial exceptions (including suspensions or diminutions) from the provisions of Article 2, special regard being had to all proper humanitarian and economic considerations and after consultation with responsible associations of employers and workers, wherever such exist.2.

Each Member will draw up a list of the exceptions made under Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention and will communicate it to the International Labour Office, and thereafter in every second year any modifications of this list which shall have been made.2. The International Labour Office will present a report on this subject to the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation.Article 7In order to facilitate the application of the provisions of this Convention, each employer, director, or manager, shall be obliged--(a) where the weekly rest is given to the whole of the staff collectively, to make known such days and hours of collective rest by means of notices posted conspicuously in the establishment or any other convenient place, or in any other manner approved by the Government;(b) where the rest period is not granted to the whole of the staff collectively, to make known, by means of a roster drawn up in accordance with the method approved by the legislation of the country, or by a regulation of the competent authority, the workers or employees subject to a special system of rest, and to indicate that system.Article 8The formal ratifications of this Convention, under the conditions set forth in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 91. This Convention shall come into force at the date on which the ratifications of two Members of the International Labour Organisation have been registered by the Director-General.2.

He shall likewise notify them of the registration of the ratifications which may be communicated subsequently by other Members of the Organisation.Article 11Each Member which ratifies this Convention agrees to bring the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 into operation not later than 1 January 1924 and to take such action as may be necessary to make these provisions effective.Article 12Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention engages to apply it to its colonies, possessions and protectorates, in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.Article 13A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered with the International Labour Office.Article 14At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 15The French and English texts of this Convention shall both be authentic.\n",

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Montreal by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Twenty-ninth Session on 19 September 1946, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to medical examination for fitness for employment in non-industrial occupations of children and young persons, which is included in the third item on the agenda of the Session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this ninth day of October of the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-six the following Convention, which may be cited as the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Non-Industrial Occupations) Convention, 1946:PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 11. This Convention applies to children and young persons employed for wages, or working directly or indirectly for gain, in non-industrial occupations.2. For the purpose of this Convention, the term non-industrial occupations includes all occupations other than those recognised by the competent authority as industrial, agricultural and maritime occupations.3. The competent authority shall define the line of division which separates non-industrial occupations from industrial, agricultural and maritime occupations.4. National laws or regulations may exempt from the application of this Convention employment, on work which is recognised as not being dangerous to the health of children or young persons, in family undertakings in which only parents and their children or wards are employed.Article 21. Children and young persons under eighteen years of age shall not be admitted to employment or work in non-industrial occupations unless they have been found fit for the work in question by a thorough medical examination.2. The medical examination for fitness for employment shall be carried out by a qualified physician approved by the competent authority and shall be certified either by a medical certificate or by an endorsement on the work permit or in the workbook.3. The document certifying fitness for employment may be issued--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) subject to specified conditions of employment;(b) for a specified job or for a group of jobs or occupations involving similar health risks which have been classified as a group by the authority responsible for the enforcement of the laws and regulations concerning medical examinations for fitness for employment.4. National laws or regulations shall specify the authority competent to issue the document certifying fitness for employment and shall define the conditions to be observed in drawing up and issuing the document.Article 31. The fitness of a child or young person for the employment in which he is engaged shall be subject to medical supervision until he has attained the age of eighteen years.2. The continued employment of a child or young person under eighteen years of age shall be subject to the repetition of medical examinations at intervals of not more than one year.3. National laws or regulations shall--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) make provision for the special circumstances in which a medical re-examination shall be required in addition to the annual examination or at more frequent intervals in order to ensure effective supervision in respect of the risks involved in the occupation and of the state of health of the child or young person as shown by previous examinations; or(b) empower the competent authority to require medical re-examinations in exceptional cases.Article 41. In occupations which involve high health risks medical examination and re-examinations for fitness for employment shall be required until at least the age of twenty-one years.2. National laws or regulations shall either specify, or empower an appropriate authority to specify, the occupations or categories of occupations in which medical examination and re-examinations for fitness for employment shall be required until at least the age of twenty-one years.Article 5The medical examinations required by the preceding articles shall not involve the child or young person, or his parents, in any expense.Article 61. Appropriate measures shall be taken by the competent authority for vocational guidance and physical and vocational rehabilitation of children and young persons found by medical examination to be unsuited to certain types of work or to have physical handicaps or limitations.2. The nature and extent of such measures shall be determined by the competent authority; for this purpose co-operation shall be established between the labour, health, educational and social services concerned, and effective liaison shall be maintained between these services in order to carry out such measures.3. National laws or regulations may provide for the issue to children and young persons whose fitness for employment is not clearly determined--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) of temporary work permits or medical certificates valid for a limited period at the expiration of which the young worker will be required to undergo re-examination;(b) of permits or certificates requiring special conditions of employment.Article 71. The employer shall be required to file and keep available to labour inspectors either the medical certificate for fitness for employment or the work permit or workbook showing that there are no medical objections to the employment as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations.2. National laws or regulations shall determine--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) the measures of identification to be adopted for ensuring the application of the system of medical examination for fitness for employment to children and young persons engaged either on their own account or on account of their parents in itinerant trading or in any other occupation carried on in the streets or in places to which the public have access; and(b) the other methods of supervision to be adopted for ensuring the strict enforcement of the Convention.PART II. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN COUNTRIESArticle 81. In the case of a Member the territory of which includes large areas where, by reason of the sparseness of the population or the stage of development of the area, the competent authority considers it impracticable to enforce the provisions of this Convention, the authority may exempt such areas from the application of the Convention either generally or with such exceptions in respect of particular undertakings or occupations as it thinks fit.2. Each Member shall indicate in its first annual report upon the application of this Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any areas in respect of which it proposes to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article and no Member shall, after the date of its first annual report, have recourse to the provisions of the present Article except in respect of areas so indicated.3. Each Member having recourse to the provisions of the present Article shall indicate in subsequent annual reports any areas in respect of which it renounces the right to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article.Article 91. Any Member which, before the date of the adoption of the laws or regulations permitting the ratification of this Convention, had no laws or regulations concerning medical examination for fitness for employment of young persons in non-industrial occupations may, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, substitute an age lower than eighteen years, but in no case lower than sixteen years, for the age of eighteen years prescribed in Articles 2 and 3 and an age lower than twenty-one years, but in no case lower than nineteen years, for the age of twenty-one years prescribed in Article 4.2. Any Member which has made such a declaration may at any time cancel the declaration by a subsequent declaration.3. Every Member for which a declaration made in virtue of paragraph 1 of this Article is in force shall indicate each year in its annual report upon the application of this Convention the extent to which any progress has been made with a view to the full application of the provisions of the Convention.PART III. FINAL ARTICLESArticle 10Nothing in this Convention shall affect any law, award, custom or agreement between employers and workers which ensures more favourable conditions than those provided by this Convention.Article 11The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 121. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2. It shall come into force twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered with the Director-General.3. Thereafter, this Convention shall come into force for any Member twelve months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.Article 131. A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered.2. Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not, within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in this Article, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms provided for in this Article.Article 141. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall notify all Members of the International Labour Organisation of the registration of all ratifications and denunciations communicated to him by the Members of the Organisation.2. When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 15The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding articles.Article 16At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 171. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this Convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides,\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 13 above, if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 18The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.\n",

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Forty-ninth Session on 2 June 1965, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to medical examination of young persons for fitness for employment underground in mines, which is included in the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andNoting that the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Industry) Convention, 1946, which is applicable to mines, provides that children and young persons under 18 years of age shall not be admitted to employment by an industrial undertaking unless they have been found fit for the work on which they are to be employed by a thorough medical examination, that the continued employment of a child or young person under 18 years of age shall be subject to the repetition of a medical examination at intervals of not more than one year, and that national laws or regulations shall make provision concerning additional re-examinations, andNoting that the Convention further provides that in occupations which involve high health risks medical examination and re-examinations for fitness for employment shall be required until at least the age of 21 years, and that national laws or regulations shall either specify or empower an appropriate authority to specify the occupations or categories of occupations to which this requirement applies, andConsidering that, in view of the health risks inherent in employment underground in mines, international standards requiring medical examination and periodic re-examination for fitness for employment underground in mines until the age of 21 years, and specifying the nature of these examinations, are desirable, andHaving determined that these standards shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty-five the following Convention, which may be cited as the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Underground Work) Convention, 1965:Article 11. For the purpose of this Convention, the term mine means any undertaking, whether public or private, for the extraction of any substance from under the surface of the earth by means involving the employment of persons underground.2. The provisions of this Convention concerning employment or work underground in mines include employment or work underground in quarries.Article 21. A thorough medical examination, and periodic re-examinations at intervals of not more than one year, for fitness for employment shall be required for the employment or work underground in mines of persons under 21 years of age.2. Alternative arrangements for medical supervision of young persons aged between 18 and 21 years shall be permitted where the competent authority is satisfied on medical advice that such arrangements are equivalent to or more effective than those required under paragraph 1 of this Article and has consulted and reached agreement with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned.Article 31. The medical examinations provided for in Article 2--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) shall be carried out under the responsibility and supervision of a qualified physician approved by the competent authority; and(b) shall be certified in an appropriate manner.2. An X-ray film of the lungs shall be required on the occasion of the initial medical examination and, when regarded as medically necessary, on the occasion of subsequent re-examinations.3.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Fifty-third Session on 4 June 1969, andNoting the terms of existing international labour Conventions concerning labour inspection, such as the Labour Inspection Convention, 1947, which applies to industry and commerce, and the Plantations Convention, 1958, which covers a limited category of agricultural undertakings, andConsidering that international standards providing for labour inspection in agriculture generally are desirable, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to labour inspection in agriculture, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-fifth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty-nine the following Convention, which may be cited as the Labour Inspection (Agriculture) Convention, 1969:Article 11. In this Convention the term agricultural undertaking means undertakings and parts of undertakings engaged in cultivation, animal husbandry including livestock production and care, forestry, horticulture, the primary processing of agricultural products by the operator of the holding or any other form of agricultural activity.2. Where necessary, the competent authority shall, after consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, define the line which separates agriculture from industry and commerce in such a manner as not to exclude any agricultural undertaking from the national system of labour inspection.3. In any case in which it is doubtful whether an undertaking or part of an undertaking is one to which this Convention applies, the question shall be settled by the competent authority.Article 2In this Convention the term legal provisions includes, in addition to laws and regulations, arbitration awards and collective agreements upon which the force of law is conferred and which are enforceable by labour inspectors.Article 3Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this Convention is in force shall maintain a system of labour inspection in agriculture.Article 4The system of labour inspection in agriculture shall apply to agricultural undertakings in which work employees or apprentices, however they may be remunerated and whatever the type, form or duration of their contract.Article 51. Any Member ratifying this Convention may, in a declaration accompanying its ratification, undertake also to cover by labour inspection in agriculture one or more of the following categories of persons working in agricultural undertakings:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) tenants who do not engage outside help, sharecroppers and similar categories of agricultural workers;(b) persons participating in a collective economic enterprise, such as members of a co-operative;(c) members of the family of the operator of the undertaking, as defined by national laws or regulations.2. Any Member which has ratified this Convention may subsequently communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a declaration undertaking to cover one or more of the categories of persons referred to in the preceding paragraph which are not already covered in virtue of a previous declaration.3. Each Member which has ratified this Convention shall indicate in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation to what extent effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the provisions of the Convention in respect of such of the categories of persons referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article as are not covered in virtue of a declaration.Article 61. The functions of the system of labour inspection in agriculture shall be--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) to secure the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work, such as provisions relating to hours, wages, weekly rest and holidays, safety, health and welfare, the employment of women, children and young persons, and other connected matters, in so far as such provisions are enforceable by labour inspectors;(b) to supply technical information and advice to employers and workers concerning the most effective means of complying with the legal provisions;(c) to bring to the notice of the competent authority defects or abuses not specifically covered by existing legal provisions and to submit to it proposals on the improvement of laws and regulations.2. National laws or regulations may give labour inspectors in agriculture advisory or enforcement functions regarding legal provisions relating to conditions of life of workers and their families.3. Any further duties which may be entrusted to labour inspectors in agriculture shall not be such as to interfere with the effective discharge of their primary duties or to prejudice in any way the authority and impartiality which are necessary to inspectors in their relations with employers and workers.Article 71. So far as is compatible with the administrative practice of the Member, labour inspection in agriculture shall be placed under the supervision and control of a central body.2. In the case of a federal State, the term central body may mean either one at federal level or one at the level of a federated unit.3. Labour inspection in agriculture might be carried out for example--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) by a single labour inspection department responsible for all sectors of economic activity;(b) by a single labour inspection department, which would arrange for internal functional specialisation through the appropriate training of inspectors called upon to exercise their functions in agriculture;(c) by a single labour inspection department, which would arrange for internal institutional specialisation by creating a technically qualified service, the officers of which would perform their functions in agriculture; or(d) by a specialised agricultural inspection service, the activity of which would be supervised by a central body vested with the same prerogatives in respect of labour inspection in other fields, such as industry, transport and commerce.Article 81. The labour inspection staff in agriculture shall be composed of public officials whose status and conditions of service are such that they are assured of stability of employment and are independent of changes of government and of improper external influences.2. So far as is compatible with national laws or regulations or with national practice, Members may include in their system of labour inspection in agriculture officials or representatives of occupational organisations, whose activities would supplement those of the public inspection staff; the persons concerned shall be assured of stability of tenure and be independent of improper external influences.Article 91. Subject to any conditions for recruitment to the public service which may be prescribed by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors in agriculture shall be recruited with sole regard to their qualifications for the performance of their duties.2. The means of ascertaining such qualifications shall be determined by the competent authority.3. Labour inspectors in agriculture shall be adequately trained for the performance of their duties and measures shall be taken to give them appropriate further training in the course of their employment.Article 10Both men and women shall be eligible for appointment to the labour inspection staff in agriculture; where necessary, special duties may be assigned to men and women inspectors.Article 11Each Member shall take the necessary measures to ensure that duly qualified technical experts and specialists, who might help to solve problems demanding technical knowledge, are associated in the work of labour inspection in agriculture in such manner as may be deemed most appropriate under national conditions.Article 121. The competent authority shall make appropriate arrangements to promote effective co-operation between the inspection services in agriculture and government services and public or approved institutions which may be engaged in similar activities.2. Where necessary, the competent authority may either entrust certain inspection functions at the regional or local level on an auxiliary basis to appropriate government services or public institutions or associate these services or institutions with the exercise of the functions in question, on condition that this does not prejudice the application of the principles of this Convention.Article 13The competent authority shall make appropriate arrangements to promote collaboration between officials of the labour inspectorate in agriculture and employers and workers, or their organisations where such exist.Article 14Arrangements shall be made to ensure that the number of labour inspectors in agriculture is sufficient to secure the effective discharge of the duties of the inspectorate and is determined with due regard for--(a) the importance of the duties which inspectors have to perform, in particular--\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t(i) the number, nature, size and situation of the agricultural undertakings liable to inspection;(ii) the number and classes of persons working in such undertakings; and(iii) the number and complexity of the legal provisions to be enforced;(b) the material means placed at the disposal of the inspectors; and(c) the practical conditions under which visits of inspection must be carried out in order to be effective.Article 151. The competent authority shall make the necessary arrangements to furnish labour inspectors in agriculture with--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) local offices so located as to take account of the geographical situation of the agricultural undertakings and of the means of communication, suitably equipped in accordance with the requirements of the service, and, in so far as possible, accessible to the persons concerned;(b) the transport facilities necessary for the performance of their duties in cases where suitable public facilities do not exist.2. The competent authority shall make the necessary arrangements to reimburse to labour inspectors in agriculture any travelling and incidental expenses which may be necessary for the performance of their duties.Article 161. Labour inspectors in agriculture provided with proper credentials shall be empowered--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) to enter freely and without previous notice at any hour of the day or night any workplace liable to inspection;(b) to enter by day any premises which they may have reasonable cause to believe to be liable to inspection;(c) to carry out any examination, test or inquiry which they may consider necessary in order to satisfy themselves that the legal provisions are being strictly observed, and in particular--\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t(i) to interview, alone or in the presence of witnesses, the employer, the staff of the undertaking or any other person in the undertaking on any matters concerning the application of the legal provisions;(ii) to require, in such manner as national laws or regulations may prescribe, the production of any books, registers or other documents the keeping of which is prescribed by national laws or regulations relating to conditions of life and work, in order to see that they are in conformity with the legal provisions, and to copy such documents or make extracts from them;(iii) to take or remove for purposes of analysis samples of products, materials and substances used or handled, subject to the employer or his representative being notified of any products, materials or substances taken or removed for such purposes.2. Labour inspectors shall not enter the private home of the operator of the undertaking in pursuance of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article except with the consent of the operator or with a special authorisation issued by the competent authority.3. On the occasion of an inspection visit, inspectors shall notify the employer or his representative, and the workers or their representatives, of their presence, unless they consider that such a notification may be prejudicial to the performance of their duties.Article 17The labour inspection services in agriculture shall be associated, in such cases and in such manner as may be determined by the competent authority, in the preventive control of new plant, new materials or substances and new methods of handling or processing products which appear likely to constitute a threat to health or safety.Article 181. Labour inspectors in agriculture shall be empowered to take steps with a view to remedying defects observed in plant, layout or working methods in agricultural undertakings, including the use of dangerous materials or substances, which they may have reasonable cause to believe constitute a threat to health or safety.2. In order to enable inspectors to take such steps they shall be empowered, subject to any right of appeal to a legal or administrative authority which may be provided by law, to make or have made orders requiring--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) such alterations to the installation, plant, premises, tools, equipment or machines, to be carried out within a specified time limit, as may be necessary to secure compliance with the legal provisions relating to health or safety; or(b) measures with immediate executory force, which can go as far as halting the work, in the event of imminent danger to health or safety.3. Where the procedure described in paragraph 2 is not compatible with the administrative or judicial practice of the Member, inspectors shall have the right to apply to the competent authority for the issue of orders or for the initiation of measures with immediate executory force.4. The defects noted by the inspector when visiting an undertaking and the orders he is making or having made in pursuance of paragraph 2 or for which he intends to apply in pursuance of paragraph 3 shall be immediately made known to the employer and the representatives of the workers.Article 191. The labour inspectorate in agriculture shall be notified of occupational accidents and cases of occupational disease occurring in the agricultural sector in such cases and in such manner as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations.2. As far as possible, inspectors shall be associated with any inquiry on the spot into the causes of the most serious occupational accidents or occupational diseases, particularly of those which affect a number of workers or have fatal consequences.Article 20Subject to such exceptions as may be made by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors in agriculture--(a) shall be prohibited from having any direct or indirect interest in the undertakings under their supervision;(b) shall be bound on pain of appropriate penalties or disciplinary measures not to reveal, even after leaving the service, any manufacturing or commercial secrets or working processes which may come to their knowledge in the course of their duties; and(c) shall treat as absolutely confidential the source of any complaint bringing to their notice a defect, a danger in working processes or a breach of legal provisions and shall give no intimation to the employer or his representative that a visit of inspection was made in consequence of the receipt of such a complaint.Article 21Agricultural undertakings shall be inspected as often and as thoroughly as is necessary to ensure the effective application of the relevant legal provisions.Article 221. Persons who violate or neglect to observe legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors in agriculture shall be liable to prompt legal or administrative proceedings without previous warning: Provided that exceptions may be made by national laws or regulations in respect of cases in which previous notice to carry out remedial or preventive measures is to be given.2. It shall be left to the discretion of labour inspectors to give warning and advice instead of instituting or recommending proceedings.Article 23If labour inspectors in agriculture are not themselves authorised to institute proceedings, they shall be empowered to refer reports of infringements of the legal provisions directly to an authority competent to institute such proceedings.Article 24Adequate penalties for violations of the legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors in agriculture and for obstructing labour inspectors in the performance of their duties shall be provided for by national laws or regulations and effectively enforced.Article 251. Labour inspectors or local inspection offices, as the case may be, shall be required to submit to the central inspection authority periodical reports on the results of their activities in agriculture.2. These reports shall be drawn up in such manner and deal with such subjects as may from time to time be prescribed by the central inspection authority; they shall be submitted at least as frequently as may be prescribed by that authority and in any case not less frequently than once a year.Article 261. The central inspection authority shall publish an annual report on the work of the inspection services in agriculture, either as a separate report or as part of its general annual report.2. Such annual reports shall be published within a reasonable time after the end of the year to which they relate and in any case within twelve months.3. Copies of the annual reports shall be transmitted to the Director-General of the International Labour Office within three months after their publication.Article 27The annual report published by the central inspection authority shall deal in particular with the following subjects, in so far as they are under the control of the said authority:(a) laws and regulations relevant to the work of labour inspection in agriculture;(b) staff of the labour inspection service in agriculture;(c) statistics of agricultural undertakings liable to inspection and the number of persons working therein;(d) statistics of inspection visits;(e) statistics of violations and penalties imposed;(f) statistics of occupational accidents, including their causes;(g) statistics of occupational diseases, including their causes.Article 28The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 291. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2. It shall come into force twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered with the Director-General.3. Thereafter, this Convention shall come into force for any Member twelve months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.Article 301. A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered.2. Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not, within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in this Article, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms provided for in this Article.Article 311. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall notify all Members of the International Labour Organisation of the registration of all ratifications and denunciations communicated to him by the Members of the Organisation.2. When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 32The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding Articles.Article 33At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 341. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this Convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 30 above, if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 35The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.\n",

Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall list in the first report on the application of the Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any groups of wage earners which may not have been covered in pursuance of this Article, giving the reasons for not covering them, and shall state in subsequent reports the positions of its law and practice in respect of the groups not covered, and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such groups.Article 21. Minimum wages shall have the force of law and shall not be subject to abatement, and failure to apply them shall make the person or persons concerned liable to appropriate penal or other sanctions.2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, the freedom of collective bargaining shall be fully respected.Article 3The elements to be taken into consideration in determining the level of minimum wages shall, so far as possible and appropriate in relation to national practice and conditions, include--(a) the needs of workers and their families, taking into account the general level of wages in the country, the cost of living, social security benefits, and the relative living standards of other social groups;(b) economic factors, including the requirements of economic development, levels of productivity and the desirability of attaining and maintaining a high level of employment.Article 41. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall create and/or maintain machinery adapted to national conditions and requirements whereby minimum wages for groups of wage earners covered in pursuance of Article 1 thereof can be fixed and adjusted from time to time.2. Provision shall be made, in connection with the establishment, operation and modification of such machinery, for full consultation with representative organisations of employers and workers concerned or, where no such organisations exist, representatives of employers and workers concerned.3. Wherever it is appropriate to the nature of the minimum wage fixing machinery, provision shall also be made for the direct participation in its operation of--\n",

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office and having met in its Sixty-second Session on 13 October 1976, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to revision of the Paid Vacations (Seafarers) Convention (Revised), 1949 (No. 91), in the light of, but not necessarily restricted to, the Holidays with Pay Convention (Revised), 1970 (No. 132), which is the second item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-ninth day of October of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy-six the following Convention, which may be cited as the Seafarers' Annual Leave with Pay Convention, 1976:Article 1The provisions of this Convention, in so far as they are not otherwise made effective by means of collective agreements, arbitration awards, court decisions, statutory wage-fixing machinery, or in such other manner consistent with national practice as may be appropriate under national conditions, shall be given effect by national laws or regulations.Article 21. This Convention applies to all persons who are employed as seafarers.2. For the purpose of this Convention, the term seafarer means a person who is employed in any capacity on board a sea-going ship registered in a territory for which the Convention is in force, other than--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) a ship of war;(b) a ship engaged in fishing or in operations directly connected therewith or in whaling or similar pursuits.3. National laws or regulations shall determine, after consultation with the organisations of shipowners and seafarers concerned, where such exist, which ships are to be regarded as sea-going ships for the purpose of this Convention.4. Each Member which ratifies this Convention may, after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, extend its application, with the modifications rendered necessary by the conditions of the industry, to the persons excluded from the definition of seafarers by paragraph 2, subparagraph (b), of this Article, or to certain categories thereof.5. Each Member which extends the application of this Convention in pursuance of paragraph 4 of this Article at the time of ratifying it shall specify in a declaration appended to its ratification the categories to which the application is extended and the modifications, if any, rendered necessary.6. Each Member which has ratified this Convention may further subsequently notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office, by a declaration, that it extends the application of the Convention to categories beyond those, if any, specified at the time of ratification.7. In so far as necessary, measures may be taken by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in a country, after consultation with the organisations of shipowners and seafarers concerned, where such exist, to exclude from the application of this Convention limited categories of persons employed on board sea-going ships.8. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall list, in the first report on the application of the Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, any categories which may have been excluded in pursuance of paragraphs 3 and 7 of this Article, giving the reasons for such exclusion, and shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice in respect of the categories excluded and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such categories.Article 31. Every seafarer to whom this Convention applies shall be entitled to annual leave with pay of a specified minimum length.2. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall specify the length of the annual leave in a declaration appended to its ratification.3. The leave shall in no case be less than 30 calendar days for one year of service.4. Each Member which has ratified this Convention may subsequently notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office, by a further declaration, that it specifies annual leave longer than that specified at the time of ratification.Article 41. A seafarer whose length of service in any year is less than that required for the full entitlement prescribed in the preceding Article shall be entitled in respect of that year to annual leave with pay proportionate to his length of service during that year.2. The expression year in this Convention shall mean the calendar year or any other period of the same length.Article 51. The manner in which the length of service is calculated for the purpose of leave entitlement shall be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.2. Under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country, service off articles shall be counted as part of the period of service.3. Under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country, absence from work to attend an approved maritime vocational training course or for such reasons beyond the control of the seafarer concerned as illness, injury or maternity shall be counted as part of the period of service.Article 6The following shall not be counted as part of the minimum annual leave with pay prescribed in Article 3, paragraph 3, of this Convention:(a) public and customary holidays recognised as such in the country of the flag, whether or not they fall during the annual leave with pay;(b) periods of incapacity for work resulting from illness, injury or maternity, under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country;(c) temporary shore leave granted to a seafarer while on articles;(d) compensatory leave of any kind, under conditions to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.Article 71. Every seafarer taking the annual leave envisaged in this Convention shall receive in respect of the full period of that leave at least his normal remuneration (including the cash equivalent of any part of that remuneration which is paid in kind), calculated in a manner to be determined by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.2. The amounts due in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be paid to the seafarer concerned in advance of the leave, unless otherwise provided by national laws or regulations or in an agreement applicable to him and the employer.3. A seafarer who leaves or is discharged from the service of his employer before he has taken annual leave due to him shall receive in respect of such leave due to him the remuneration provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article.Article 81. The division of the annual leave with pay into parts, or the accumulation of such annual leave due in respect of one year together with a subsequent period of leave, may be authorised by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country.2. Subject to paragraph 1 of this Article and unless otherwise provided in an agreement applicable to the employer and the seafarer concerned, the annual leave with pay prescribed by this Convention shall consist of an uninterrupted period.Article 9In exceptional cases, provision may be made by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery in each country for the substitution for annual leave due in virtue of this Convention of a cash payment at least equivalent to the remuneration provided for in Article 7.Article 101. The time at which the leave is to be taken shall, unless it is fixed by regulation, collective agreement, arbitration award or other means consistent with national practice, be determined by the employer after consultation and, as far as possible, in agreement with the seafarer concerned or his representatives.2. No seafarer shall be required without his consent to take annual leave due to him at a place other than that where he was engaged or recruited, whichever is nearer his home, except under the provisions of a collective agreement or of national laws or regulations.3. If a seafarer is required to take his annual leave from a place other than that permitted by paragraph 2 of this Article, he shall be entitled to free transportation to the place where he was engaged or recruited, whichever is nearer his home, and subsistence and other costs directly involved in his return there shall be for the account of the employer; the travel time involved shall not be deducted from the annual leave with pay due to the seafarer.Article 11Any agreement to relinquish the right to the minimum annual leave with pay prescribed in Article 3, paragraph 3, or--except as provided, exceptionally, in pursuance of Article 9 of this Convention--to forgo such leave, shall be null and void.Article 12A seafarer taking annual leave shall be recalled only in cases of extreme emergency, with due notice.Article 13Effective measures appropriate to the manner in which effect is given to the provisions of this Convention shall be taken to ensure the proper application and enforcement of regulations or provisions concerning annual leave with pay, by means of adequate inspection or otherwise.Article 14This Convention revises the Paid Vacations (Seafarers) Convention (Revised), 1949.Article 15The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 161.

A Member ratifying this Convention may, after consultation with the representative organisations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist, exclude from the application of the Convention particular branches of economic activity in respect of which special problems of a substantial nature arise.3. Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall list in the first report on the application of the Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any branches which may have been excluded in pursuance of paragraph 2 of this Article, giving the reasons for such exclusion, and shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice in respect of the branches excluded, and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such branches.Article 21. Each Member, after consultation with the representative organisations of employers and workers, where such exist, may accept the obligations of this Convention separately in respect of--\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) air pollution;(b) noise; and(c) vibration.2. A Member which does not accept the obligations of the Convention in respect of one or more of the categories of hazards shall specify this in its ratification and shall give reasons in the first report on the application of the Convention submitted under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation; it shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice in respect of the category or categories of hazards excluded and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of each such category of hazards.3. Each Member which has not on ratification accepted the obligations of this Convention in respect of all the categories of hazards shall subsequently, when it is satisfied that conditions permit this, notify the Director-General of the International Labour Office that it accepts the obligations of the Convention in respect of a category or categories previously excluded.Article 3For the purpose of this Convention--(a) the term air pollution covers all air contaminated by substances, whatever their physical state, which are harmful to health or otherwise dangerous;(b) the term noise covers all sound which can result in hearing impairment or be harmful to health or otherwise dangerous;(c) the term vibration covers any vibration which is transmitted to the human body through solid structures and is harmful to health or otherwise dangerous.PART II. GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 41. National laws or regulations shall prescribe that measures be taken for the prevention and control of, and protection against, occupational hazards in the working environment due to air pollution, noise and vibration.2. Provisions concerning the practical implementation of the measures so prescribed may be adopted through technical standards, codes of practice and other appropriate methods.Article 51. In giving effect to the provisions of this Convention, the competent authority shall act in consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned.2.

Employers shall be made responsible for compliance with the prescribed measures.2. Whenever two or more employers undertake activities simultaneously at one workplace, they shall have the duty to collaborate in order to comply with the prescribed measures, without prejudice to the responsibility of each employer for the health and safety of his employees.

PREVENTIVE AND PROTECTIVE MEASUREArticle 81. The competent authority shall establish criteria for determining the hazards of exposure to air pollution, noise and vibration in the working environment and, where appropriate, shall specify exposure limits on the basis of these criteria.2. In the elaboration of the criteria and the determination of the exposure limits the competent authority shall take into account the opinion of technically competent persons designated by the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned.3. The criteria and exposure limits shall be established, supplemented and revised regularly in the light of current national and international knowledge and data, taking into account as far as possible any increase in occupational hazards resulting from simultaneous exposure to several harmful factors at the workplace.Article 9As far as possible, the working environment shall be kept free from any hazard due to air pollution, noise or vibration--(a) by technical measures applied to new plant or processes in design or installation, or added to existing plant or processes; or, where this is not possible,(b) by supplementary organisational measures.Article 10Where the measures taken in pursuance of Article 9 do not bring air pollution, noise and vibration in the working environment within the limits specified in pursuance of Article 8, the employer shall provide and maintain suitable personal protective equipment.

The supervision provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be free of cost to the worker concerned.3. Where continued assignment to work involving exposure to air pollution, noise or vibration is found to be medically inadvisable, every effort shall be made, consistent with national practice and conditions, to provide the worker concerned with suitable alternative employment or to maintain his income through social security measures or otherwise.4. In implementing this Convention, the rights of workers under social security or social insurance legislation shall not be adversely affected.Article 12The use of processes, substances, machinery and equipment, to be specified by the competent authority, which involve exposure of workers to occupational hazards in the working environment due to air pollution, noise or vibration, shall be notified to the competent authority and the competent authority, as appropriate, may authorise the use on prescribed conditions or prohibit it.Article 13All persons concerned shall be adequately and suitably--(a) informed of potential occupational hazards in the working environment due to air pollution, noise and vibration; and(b) instructed in the measures available for the prevention and control of, and protection against, those hazards.Article 14Measures taking account of national conditions and resources shall be taken to promote research in the field of prevention and control of hazards in the working environment due to air pollution, noise and vibration.PART IV.

Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this Convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 19 above, if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 24The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.\n",

      "\t\t\tPreamble\n",
      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Seventy-fifth Session on 1 June 1988, andEmphasising the importance of work and productive employment in any society not only because of the resources which they create for the community, but also because of the income which they bring to workers, the social role which they confer and the feeling of self-esteem which workers derive from them, andRecalling the existing international standards in the field of employment and unemployment protection (the Unemployment Provision Convention and Recommendation, 1934, the Unemployment (Young Persons) Recommendation, 1935, the Income Security Recommendation, 1944, the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952, the Employment Policy Convention and Recommendation, 1964, the Human Resources Development Convention and Recommendation, 1975, the Labour Administration Convention and Recommendation, 1978, and the Employment Policy (Supplementary Provisions) Recommendation, 1984), andConsidering the widespread unemployment and underemployment affecting various countries throughout the world at all stages of development and in particular the problems of young people, many of whom are seeking their first employment, andConsidering that, since the adoption of the international instruments concerning protection against unemployment referred to above, there have been important new developments in the law and practice of many Members necessitating the revision of existing standards, in particular the Unemployment Provision Convention, 1934, and the adoption of new international standards concerning the promotion of full, productive and freely chosen employment by all appropriate means, including social security, andNoting that the provisions concerning unemployment benefit in the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952, lay down a level of protection that has now been surpassed by most of the existing compensation schemes in the industrialised countries and, unlike standards concerning other benefits, have not been followed by higher standards, but that the standards in question can still constitute a target for developing countries that are in a position to set up an unemployment compensation scheme, andRecognising that policies leading to stable, sustained, non-inflationary economic growth and a flexible response to change, as well as to creation and promotion of all forms of productive and freely chosen employment including small undertakings, co-operatives, self-employment and local initiatives for employment, even through the re-distribution of resources currently devoted to the financing of purely assistance-oriented activities towards activities which promote employment especially vocational guidance, training and rehabilitation, offer the best protection against the adverse effects of involuntary unemployment, but that involuntary unemployment nevertheless exists and that it is therefore important to ensure that social security systems should provide employment assistance and economic support to those who are involuntarily unemployed, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to employment promotion and social security which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session with a view, in particular, to revising the Unemployment Provision Convention, 1934, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this twenty-first day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight the following Convention, which may be cited as the Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988:I. GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1In this Convention:(a) the term legislation includes any social security rules as well as laws and regulations;(b) the term prescribed means determined by or in virtue of national legislation.Article 2Each Member shall take appropriate steps to co-ordinate its system of protection against unemployment and its employment policy. To this end, it shall seek to ensure that its system of protection against unemployment, and in particular the methods of providing unemployment benefit, contribute to the promotion of full, productive and freely chosen employment, and are not such as to discourage employers from offering and workers from seeking productive employment.Article 3The provisions of this Convention shall be implemented in consultation and co-operation with the organisations of employers and workers, in accordance with national practice.Article 41. Each Member which ratifies this Convention may, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, exclude the provisions of Part VII from the obligations accepted by ratification.2. Each Member which has made a declaration under paragraph 1 above may withdraw it at any time by a subsequent declaration.Article 51. Each Member may avail itself, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, of at most two of the temporary exceptions provided for in Article 10, paragraph 4, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 15, paragraph 2, Article 18, paragraph 2, Article 19, paragraph 4, Article 23, paragraph 2, Article 24, paragraph 2, and Article 25, paragraph 2. Such a declaration shall state the reasons which justify these exceptions.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, a Member, where it is justified by the extent of protection of its social security system, may avail itself, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, of the temporary exceptions provided for in Article 10, paragraph 4, Article 11, paragraph 3, Article 15, paragraph 2, Article 18, paragraph 2, Article 19, paragraph 4, Article 23, paragraph 2, Article 24, paragraph 2 and Article 25, paragraph 2. Such a declaration shall state the reasons which justify these exceptions.3. Each Member which has made a declaration under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 shall include in its reports on the application of this Convention submitted under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation a statement in respect of each exception of which it avails itself-\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) that its reason for doing so subsists; or(b) that it renounces its right to avail itself of the exception in question as from a stated date.4.

Each Member shall ensure equality of treatment for all persons protected, without discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, nationality, ethnic or social origin, disability or age.2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not prevent the adoption of special measures which are justified by the circumstances of identified groups under the schemes referred to in Article 12, paragraph 2, or are designed to meet the specific needs of categories of persons who have particular problems in the labour market, in particular disadvantaged groups, or the conclusion between States of bilateral or multilateral agreements relating to unemployment benefits on the basis of reciprocity.II. PROMOTION OF PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENTArticle 7Each Member shall declare as a priority objective a policy designed to promote full, productive and freely chosen employment by all appropriate means, including social security. Such means should include, inter alia, employment services, vocational training and vocational guidance.Article 81. Each Member shall endeavour to establish, subject to national law and practice, special programmes to promote additional job opportunities and employment assistance and to encourage freely chosen and productive employment for identified categories of disadvantaged persons having or liable to have difficulties in finding lasting employment such as women, young workers, disabled persons, older workers, the long-term unemployed, migrant workers lawfully resident in the country and workers affected by structural change.2. Each Member shall specify, in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, the categories of persons for whom it undertakes to promote employment programmes.3. Each Member shall endeavour to extend the promotion of productive employment progressively to a greater number of categories than the number initially covered.Article 9The measures envisaged in this Part shall be taken in the light of the Human Resources Development Convention and Recommendation, 1975, and the Employment Policy (supplementary Provisions) Recommendation, 1984.III. CONTINGENCIES COVEREDArticle 101. The contingencies covered shall include, under prescribed conditions, full unemployment defined as the loss of earnings due to inability to obtain suitable employment with due regard to the provisions of Article 21, paragraph 2, in the case of a person capable of working, available for work and actually seeking work.2. Each Member shall endeavour to extend the protection of the Convention, under prescribed conditions, to the following contingencies -\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) loss of earnings due to partial unemployment, defined as a temporary reduction in the normal or statutory hours of work; and(b) suspension or reduction of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work, without any break in the employment relationship for reasons of, in particular, an economic, technological, structural or similar nature.3. Each Member shall in addition endeavour to provide the payment of benefits to part-time workers who are actually seeking full-time work. The total of benefits and earnings from their part-time work may be such as to maintain incentives to take up full-time work.4. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraphs 2 and 3 above may be deferred.IV. PERSONS PROTECTEDArticle 111. The persons protected shall comprise prescribed classes of employees, constituting not less than 85 per cent of all employees, including public employees and apprentices.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, public employees whose employment up to normal retiring age is guaranteed by national laws or regulations may be excluded from protection.3. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the persons protected shall comprise-\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) prescribed classes of employees constituting not less than 50 per cent of all employees; or(b) where specifically justified by the level of development, prescribed classes of employees constituting not less than 50 per cent of all employees in industrial workplaces employing 20 persons or more.V. METHODS OF PROTECTIONArticle 121. Unless it is otherwise provided in this Convention, each Member may determine the method or methods of protection by which it chooses to put into effect the provisions of the Convention, whether by a contributory or non-contributory system, or by a combination of such systems.2. Nevertheless, if the legislation of a Member protects all residents whose resources, during the contingency, do not exceed prescribed limits, the protection afforded may be limited, in the light of the resources of the beneficiary and his or her family, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16.VI. BENEFIT TO BE PROVIDEDArticle 13Benefits provided in the form of periodical payments to the unemployed may be related to the methods of protection.Article 14In cases of full unemployment, benefits shall be provided in the form of periodical payments calculated in such a way as to provide the beneficiary with partial and transitional wage replacement and, at the same time, to avoid creating disincentives either to work or to employment creation.Article 151. In cases of full unemployment and suspension of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work without any break in the employment relationship, when this contingency is covered, benefits shall be provided in the form of periodical payments, calculated as follows:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) where these benefits are based on the contributions of or on behalf of the person protected or on previous earnings, they shall be fixed at not less than 50 per cent of previous earnings, it being permitted to fix a maximum for the amount of the benefit or for the earnings to be taken into account, which may be related, for example, to the wage of a skilled manual employee or to the average wage of workers in the region concerned;(b) where such benefits are not based on contributions or previous earnings, they shall be fixed at not less than 50 per cent of the statutory minimum wage or of the wage of an ordinary labourer, or at a level which provides the minimum essential for basic living expenses, whichever is the highest;2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the amount of the benefits shall be equal-\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) to not less than 45 per cent of the previous earnings; or(b) to not less than 45 per cent of the statutory minimum wage or of the wage of an ordinary labourer but no less than a level which provides the minimum essential for basic living expenses.3. If appropriate, the percentages specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 may be reached by comparing net periodical payments after tax and contributions with net earnings after tax and contributions.Article 16Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15, the benefit provided beyond the initial period specified in Article 19, paragraph 2 (a), as well as benefits paid by a Member in accordance with Article 12, paragraph 2, may be fixed after taking account of other resources, beyond a prescribed limit, available to the beneficiary and his or her family, in accordance with a prescribed scale. In any case, these benefits, in combination with any other benefits to which they may be entitled, shall guarantee them healthy and reasonable living conditions in accordance with national standards.Article 171. Where the legislation of a Member makes the right to unemployment benefit conditional upon the completion of a qualifying period, this period shall not exceed the length deemed necessary to prevent abuse.2. Each Member shall endeavour to adapt the qualifying period to the occupational circumstances of seasonal workers.Article 181. If the legislation of a Member provides that the payment of benefit in cases of full unemployment should begin only after the expiry of a waiting period, such period shall not exceed seven days.2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the length of the waiting period shall not exceed ten days.3. In the case of seasonal workers the waiting period specified in paragraph 1 above may be adapted to their occupational circumstances.Article 191. The benefits provided in cases of full unemployment and suspension of earnings due to a temporary suspension of work without any break in the employment relationship shall be paid throughout these contingencies.2. Nevertheless, in the case of full unemployment-\n",

The benefit to which a protected person would have been entitled in the case of full unemployment may be refused, withdrawn, suspended or reduced, to the extent prescribed, when the person concerned refuses to accept suitable employment.2. In assessing the suitability of employment, account shall be taken, in particular, under prescribed conditions and to an appropriate extent, of the age of unemployed persons, their length of service in their former occupation, their acquired experience, the length of their period of unemployment, the labour market situation, the impact of the employment in question on their personal and family situation and whether the employment is vacant as a direct result of a stoppage of work due to an on-going labour dispute.Article 22When protected persons have received directly from their employer or from any other source under national laws or regulations or collective agreements, severance pay, the principal purpose of which is to contribute towards compensating them for the loss of earnings suffered in the event of full unemployment-(a) the unemployment benefit to which the persons concerned would be entitled may be suspended for a period corresponding to that during which the severance pay compensates for the loss of earnings suffered; or(b) the severance pay may be reduced by an amount corresponding to the value converted into a lump sum of the unemployment benefit to which the persons concerned are entitled for a period corresponding to that during which the severance pay compensates for the loss of earnings suffered,as each Member may decide.Article 231.

Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraph 1 above may be deferred.Article 251. Each Member shall ensure that statutory social security schemes which are based on occupational activity are adjusted to the occupational circumstances of part-time workers, unless their hours of work or earnings can be considered, under prescribed conditions, as negligible.2. Where a declaration made in virtue of Article 5 is in force, the implementation of paragraph 1 above may be deferred.VII. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR NEW APPLICANTS FOR EMPLOYMENTArticle 261. Members shall take account of the fact that there are many categories of persons seeking work who have never been, or have ceased to be, recognised as unemployed or have never been, or have ceased to be, covered by schemes for the protection of the unemployed.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its 76th Session on 7 June 1989, andNoting the international standards contained in the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention and Recommendation, 1957, andRecalling the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the many international instruments on the prevention of discrimination, andConsidering that the developments which have taken place in international law since 1957, as well as developments in the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in all regions of the world, have made it appropriate to adopt new international standards on the subject with a view to removing the assimilationist orientation of the earlier standards, andRecognising the aspirations of these peoples to exercise control over their own institutions, ways of life and economic development and to maintain and develop their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live, andNoting that in many parts of the world these peoples are unable to enjoy their fundamental human rights to the same degree as the rest of the population of the States within which they live, and that their laws, values, customs and perspectives have often been eroded, andCalling attention to the distinctive contributions of indigenous and tribal peoples to the cultural diversity and social and ecological harmony of humankind and to international co-operation and understanding, andNoting that the following provisions have been framed with the co-operation of the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the World Health Organisation, as well as of the Inter-American Indian Institute, at appropriate levels and in their respective fields, and that it is proposed to continue this co-operation in promoting and securing the application of these provisions, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to the partial revision of the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957 (No. 107), which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention revising the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957;adopts this twenty-seventh day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine the following Convention, which may be cited as the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989;PART I. GENERAL POLICYArticle 11. This Convention applies to:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations;(b) peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.2. Self-identification as indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the provisions of this Convention apply.3. The use of the term peoples in this Convention shall not be construed as having any implications as regards the rights which may attach to the term under international law.Article 21. Governments shall have the responsibility for developing, with the participation of the peoples concerned, co-ordinated and systematic action to protect the rights of these peoples and to guarantee respect for their integrity.2. Such action shall include measures for:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) ensuring that members of these peoples benefit on an equal footing from the rights and opportunities which national laws and regulations grant to other members of the population;(b) promoting the full realisation of the social, economic and cultural rights of these peoples with respect for their social and cultural identity, their customs and traditions and their institutions;(c) assisting the members of the peoples concerned to eliminate socio-economic gaps that may exist between indigenous and other members of the national community, in a manner compatible with their aspirations and ways of life.Article 31. Indigenous and tribal peoples shall enjoy the full measure of human rights and fundamental freedoms without hindrance or discrimination.

The consultations carried out in application of this Convention shall be undertaken, in good faith and in a form appropriate to the circumstances, with the objective of achieving agreement or consent to the proposed measures.Article 71. The peoples concerned shall have the right to decide their own priorities for the process of development as it affects their lives, beliefs, institutions and spiritual well-being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use, and to exercise control, to the extent possible, over their own economic, social and cultural development. In addition, they shall participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly.2. The improvement of the conditions of life and work and levels of health and education of the peoples concerned, with their participation and co-operation, shall be a matter of priority in plans for the overall economic development of areas they inhabit. Special projects for development of the areas in question shall also be so designed as to promote such improvement.3.

The rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall be recognised. In addition, measures shall be taken in appropriate cases to safeguard the right of the peoples concerned to use lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities. Particular attention shall be paid to the situation of nomadic peoples and shifting cultivators in this respect.2. Governments shall take steps as necessary to identify the lands which the peoples concerned traditionally occupy, and to guarantee effective protection of their rights of ownership and possession.3. Adequate procedures shall be established within the national legal system to resolve land claims by the peoples concerned.Article 151. The rights of the peoples concerned to the natural resources pertaining to their lands shall be specially safeguarded. These rights include the right of these peoples to participate in the use, management and conservation of these resources.2. In cases in which the State retains the ownership of mineral or sub-surface resources or rights to other resources pertaining to lands, governments shall establish or maintain procedures through which they shall consult these peoples, with a view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their interests would be prejudiced, before undertaking or permitting any programmes for the exploration or exploitation of such resources pertaining to their lands. The peoples concerned shall wherever possible participate in the benefits of such activities, and shall receive fair compensation for any damages which they may sustain as a result of such activities.Article 161. Subject to the following paragraphs of this Article, the peoples concerned shall not be removed from the lands which they occupy.2.

Whenever possible, these peoples shall have the right to return to their traditional lands, as soon as the grounds for relocation cease to exist.4. When such return is not possible, as determined by agreement or, in the absence of such agreement, through appropriate procedures, these peoples shall be provided in all possible cases with lands of quality and legal status at least equal to that of the lands previously occupied by them, suitable to provide for their present needs and future development. Where the peoples concerned express a preference for compensation in money or in kind, they shall be so compensated under appropriate guarantees.5. Persons thus relocated shall be fully compensated for any resulting loss or injury.Article 171.

Any special training programmes shall be based on the economic environment, social and cultural conditions and practical needs of the peoples concerned.

      "\t\tThe General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its 79th Session on 3 June 1992, andStressing the importance of the protection of workers' claims in the event of the insolvency of their employer and recalling the provisions on this subject in Article 11 of the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949, and Article 11 of the Workmen's Compensation (Accidents) Convention, 1925, andNoting that, since the adoption of the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949, greater value has been placed on the rehabilitation of insolvent enterprises and that, because of the social and economic consequences of insolvency, efforts should be made where possible to rehabilitate enterprises and safeguard employment, andNoting that since the adoption of the aforementioned standards, significant developments have taken place in the law and practice of many Members which have improved the protection of workers' claims in the event of insolvency of their employer, and considering that it would be timely for the Conference to adopt new standards on the subject of workers' claims, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to the protection of workers' claims in the event of the insolvency of their employer, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention;adopts this twenty-third day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two the following Convention, which may be cited as the Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention, 1992.PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 11. For the purposes of this Convention, the term insolvency refers to situations in which, in accordance with national law and practice, proceedings have been opened relating to an employer's assets with a view to the collective reimbursement of its creditors.2. For the purposes of this Convention, a Member may extend the term \"insolvency\" to other situations in which workers' claims cannot be paid by reason of the financial situation of the employer, for example where the amount of the employer's assets is recognised as being insufficient to justify the opening of insolvency proceedings.3. The extent to which an employer's assets are subject to the proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be determined by national laws, regulations or practice.Article 2The provisions of this Convention shall be applied by means of laws or regulations or by any other means consistent with national practice.Article 31. A Member which ratifies this Convention shall accept either the obligations of Part II, providing for the protection of workers' claims by means of a privilege, or the obligations of Part III, providing for the protection of workers' claims by a guarantee institution, or the obligations of both Parts. This choice shall be indicated in a declaration accompanying its ratification.2. A Member which has initially accepted only Part II or only Part III of this Convention may thereafter, by a declaration communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, extend its acceptance to the other Part.3. A Member which accepts the obligations of both Parts of this Convention may, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, limit the application of Part III to certain categories of workers and to certain branches of economic activity. Such limitations shall be specified in the declaration of acceptance.4. A Member which has limited its acceptance of the obligations of Part III in accordance with paragraph 3 above shall, in its first report under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, give the reasons for limiting its acceptance. In subsequent reports it shall provide information on any extension of the protection under Part III of this Convention to other categories of workers or other branches of economic activity.5. A Member which has accepted the obligations of Parts II and III of this Convention may, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, exclude from the application of Part II those claims which are protected pursuant to Part III.6. Acceptance by a Member of the obligations of Part II of this Convention shall ipso jure involve the termination of its obligations under Article 11 of the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949.7. A Member which has accepted only the obligations of Part III of this Convention may, by a declaration communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, terminate its obligations under Article 11 of the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949, in respect of those claims which are protected pursuant to Part III.Article 41. Subject to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 below, and to any limitations specified in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 3, this Convention shall apply to all employees and to all branches of economic activity.2. The competent authority, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, may exclude from Part II, Part III or both Parts of this Convention specific categories of workers, in particular public employees, by reason of the particular nature of their employment relationship, or if there are other types of guarantee affording them protection equivalent to that provided by the Convention.3. A Member availing itself of the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 above shall, in its reports under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, provide information on such exceptions, giving the reasons therefor.PART II. PROTECTION OF WORKERS' CLAIMS BY MEANS OF A PRIVILEGEPROTECTED CLAIMSArticle 5In the event of an employer's insolvency, workers' claims arising out of their employment shall be protected by a privilege so that they are paid out of the assets of the insolvent employer before non-privileged creditors can be paid their share.Article 6The privilege shall cover at least:(a) the workers' claims for wages relating to a prescribed period, which shall not be less than three months, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;(b) the workers' claims for holiday pay due as a result of work performed during the year in which the insolvency or the termination of the employment occurred, and in the preceding year;(c) the workers' claims for amounts due in respect of other types of paid absence relating to a prescribed period, which shall not be less than three months, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;(d) severance pay due to workers upon termination of their employment.LIMITATIONSArticle 71. National laws or regulations may limit the protection by privilege of workers' claims to a prescribed amount, which shall not be below a socially acceptable level.2. Where the privilege afforded to workers' claims is so limited, the prescribed amount shall be adjusted as necessary so as to maintain its value.RANK OF PRIVILEGEArticle 81. National laws or regulations shall give workers' claims a higher rank of privilege than most other privileged claims, and in particular those of the State and the social security system.2. However, where workers' claims are protected by a guarantee institution in accordance with Part III of this Convention, the claims so protected may be given a lower rank of privilege than those of the State and the social security system.PART III. PROTECTION OF WORKERS' CLAIMS BY A GUARANTEE INSTITUTIONGENERAL PRINCIPLESArticle 9The payment of workers' claims against their employer arising out of their employment shall be guaranteed through a guarantee institution when payment cannot be made by the employer because of insolvency.Article 10In giving effect to this Part of the Convention, a Member may, after consulting the most representative organisations of employers and workers, adopt appropriate measures for the purpose of preventing possible abuse.Article 111. The organisation, management, operation and financing of wage guarantee institutions shall be determined pursuant to Article 2.2. The preceding paragraph shall not prevent a Member, in accordance with its particular characteristics and needs, from allowing insurance companies to provide the protection referred to in Article 9, as long as they offer sufficient guarantees.CLAIMS PROTECTED BY A GUARANTEE INSTITUTIONArticle 12The workers' claims protected pursuant to this Part of the Convention shall include at least:(a) the workers' claims for wages relating to a prescribed period, which shall not be less than eight weeks, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;(b) the workers' claims for holiday pay due as a result of work performed during a prescribed period, which shall not be less than six months, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of the employment;(c) the workers' claims for amounts due in respect of other types of paid absence relating to a prescribed period, which shall not be less than eight weeks, prior to the insolvency or prior to the termination of employment;(d) severance pay due to workers upon termination of their employment.Article 131. Claims protected pursuant to this Part of the Convention may be limited to a prescribed amount, which shall not be below a socially acceptable level.2. Where the claims protected are so limited, the prescribed amount shall be adjusted as necessary so as to maintain its value.FINAL PROVISIONSArticle 14This Convention revises the Protection of Wages Convention, 1949, to the extent provided for in Article 3, paragraphs 6 and 7 above, but does not close that Convention to further ratifications.Article 15The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 161. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2. It shall come into force twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered with the Director-General.3. Thereafter, this Convention shall come into force for any Member twelve months after the date on which its ratification has been registered.Article 171. A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.

When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 19The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding Articles.Article 20At such times as it may consider necessary, the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 211.

This Convention applies to all part-time workers, it being understood that a Member may, after consulting the representative organizations of employers and workers concerned, exclude wholly or partly from its scope particular categories of workers or of establishments when its application to them would raise particular problems of a substantial nature.2. Each Member having ratified this Convention which avails itself of the possibility afforded in the preceding paragraph shall, in its reports on the application of the Convention under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, indicate any particular category of workers or of establishments thus excluded and the reasons why this exclusion was or is still judged necessary.Article 4Measures shall be taken to ensure that part-time workers receive the same protection as that accorded to comparable full-time workers in respect of:(a) the right to organize, the right to bargain collectively and the right to act as workers' representatives;(b) occupational safety and health;(c) discrimination in employment and occupation.Article 5Measures appropriate to national law and practice shall be taken to ensure that part-time workers do not, solely because they work part time, receive a basic wage which, calculated proportionately on an hourly, performance-related, or piece-rate basis, is lower than the basic wage of comparable full-time workers, calculated according to the same method.Article 6Statutory social security schemes which are based on occupational activity shall be adapted so that part-time workers enjoy conditions equivalent to those of comparable full-time workers; these conditions may be determined in proportion to hours of work, contributions or earnings, or through other methods consistent with national law and practice.Article 7Measures shall be taken to ensure that part-time workers receive conditions equivalent to those of comparable full-time workers in the fields of:(a) maternity protection;(b) termination of employment;(c) paid annual leave and paid public holidays; and(d) sick leave,it being understood that pecuniary entitlements may be determined in proportion to hours of work or earnings.Article 81.

A Member which avails itself of the possibility provided for in paragraph 1 above shall:\n",
      "\t\t\t(a) periodically review the thresholds in force;(b) in its reports on the application of the Convention under article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, indicate the thresholds in force, the reasons therefor and whether consideration is being given to the progressive extension of protection to the workers excluded.4. The most representative organizations of employers and workers shall be consulted on the establishment, review and revision of the thresholds referred to in this Article.Article 91. Measures shall be taken to facilitate access to productive and freely chosen part-time work which meets the needs of both employers and workers, provided that the protection referred to in Articles 4 to 7 is ensured.2.
