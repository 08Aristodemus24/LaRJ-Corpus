      "FACTS & RULING OF THE COURT:\n",
      "The Supreme Court [en banc] did not rule on the factual issues of the case but instead re-examined, inter alia, Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7902 [effective March 18, 1995] on the issue of where to elevate on appeal the decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission [NLRC].cralaw\n",
      "The High Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals consistent with the new ruling enunciated therein that the \"appeals\" contemplated under the law from the decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission to the Supreme Court should be interpreted to mean \"petitions for certiorari under Rule 65\" and consequently, should no longer be brought directly to the Supreme Court but initially to the Court of Appeals.cralaw\n",
      "Before this new en banc ruling, the Supreme Court has consistently held that decisions of the NLRC may be elevated directly to the Supreme Court only by way of a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65.  There was no ruling allowing resort to the Court of Appeals.cralaw\n",
      "In support of this new view, the Supreme Court ratiocinated, insofar as pertinent, as follows:chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary\n",
      "  \"While we do not wish to intrude into the Congressional sphere on the matter of the wisdom of a law, on this score we add the further observations that there is a growing number of labor cases being elevated to this Court which, not being a trier of fact, has at times been constrained to remand the case to the NLRC for resolution of unclear or ambiguous factual findings; that the Court of Appeals is procedurally equipped for that purpose, aside from the increased number of its competent divisions; and that there is undeniably an imperative need for expeditious action on labor cases as a major aspect of constitutional protection to labor.\n",
      "\"Therefore, all references in the amended Section 9 of B. P. No. 129 to supposed appeals from the NLRC to the Supreme Court are interpreted and hereby declared to mean and refer to petitions for certiorari under Rule 65.  Consequently, all such petitions should henceforth be initially filed in the Court of Appeals in strict observance of the doctrine on the hierarchy of courts as the appropriate forum for the relief desired.\n",

      "[N.B.:  To provide for quick surfing and convenient reading, the Editorial Board of Chan Robles Virtual Law Library quoted only the summation portion of the decision which, in its view, expresses the essential intendment of the Court.  It must be pointed out that the original decision of the Supreme Court consisted of 17 pages embodying the lengthy opinion and dissertation on the legal justification for this change in the rules.

      "In line with the program to promote industrial peace as an essential requirement to achieve national economic and social programs, the following guidelines shall be observed in the conduct and disposition of labor disputes by all concerned. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "RIGHT TO STRIKE OR LOCKOUT\n",
      "1.  The right to strike is a constitutional and legal right of the workers as employers have the right to lockout, all within the context of labor relations and collective bargaining. Subject to the enactment by Congress of amendments or a new law on labor relations, the provisions of existing laws shall govern the exercise of those rights. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\n",
      "2.  The exercise of the rights to strike or lockout shall be subject to the following requirements:chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary\n",
      "(a)  a strike or lockout notice shall be filed with the labor department at least 15 days if the issues raised are unfair labor practice or at least 30 days if the issue involved bargaining deadlock.\n",
      "(b)  the strike or lockout shall be supported by a majority vote of the members of the union or of the members of the board of directors of corporations or associations or partnership, obtained by secret ballot in a meeting called for the purpose; and\n",
      "(c)  strike lockout vote shall be reported to the labor department at least 7 days before the intended strike or lockout.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  In case of dismissal from employment of union officers duly elected in accordance with the union constitution and by-laws, which may constitute union busting where the existence of the union is threatened, the 15-day cooling-off period shall not apply and the union may take action immediately. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "4.  The requirements for valid strike or lockout are mandatory in character and non-compliance therewith is sufficient ground to declare the strike or lockout illegal, upon the filing of a proper petition and after due hearing with the appropriate Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations Commission. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "VALID GROUNDS FOR STRIKE OR LOCKOUT\n",
      "5.  The law recognizes two grounds for the valid exercise of the right to strike or lockout, namely:chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary\n",
      "(a)  unfair labor practices, and chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "(b)  bargaining deadlock chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "\n",
      "Inter-union and intra-union disputes and violation of labor standards laws are not valid grounds for strike or lockout. The law provides for med-arbitration procedures in the disposition of inter and intra-union disputes and labor enforcement in the case of labor standards violation.\n",
      "6.  In order to be valid, the notice of strike or lockout on grounds of unfair labor practice, shall state the specific acts complained of. In case of bargaining deadlock, the notice must specify the unresolved issues and must show proof that the parties have exhausted all efforts to resolve the deadlock.\n",
      "7.  If on the face of the notice, the issues raised are nonstrikeable, the Regional Office shall dismiss motu proprio the notice without prejudice to conciliation upon request of either or both parties. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "CONCILIATION\n",
      "8.  Upon receipt of a valid notice of strike or lockout, it shall be the duty of the labor conciliators to call the parties to a conference immediately within a period not exceeding 48 hours. Notices of conference to the parties shall be done through the fastest available means of communication such as telephones and telegrams.\n",
      "9.  During the initial conference, it shall be the duty of the conciliator to see to it that the issues raised in the notice are properly identified. If the issue involves alleged unfair labor practice, the conciliator should clarify with the parties the specific acts of unfair labor practice. If the acts complained of involved dismissal of duly elected union officers which may constitute union busting and where the existence of the union is threatened, the conciliator shall conducted marathon conferences and exert efforts to help the parties settle the issue.\n",
      "10.  If the unfair labor practice acts complained of involves alleged violation of CBA and questions of interpretation or implementation of the agreement, the conciliator shall encourage the parties to respect the provisions of the collective agreement and to avail of the established grievance machinery including voluntary arbitration. If the parties decide to designate the conciliator as voluntary arbitrator, his or her acceptance of such designation shall be subject to Department Order No. 10, Series of 1987. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "11.  In cases of bargaining deadlocks, the conciliator shall conduct marathon or series of conferences to enable the parties to reach an agreement before the expiration of the 30-day cooling-off period.\n",
      "12.  If the issue involves alleged violation of labor standards, the conciliator shall immediately inform the Regional Director concerned about the alleged violation. In such a case, the Director shall immediately assign a labor inspector to act on the reported violation and to submit a report of his findings within 24 hours, copy furnished the conciliator concerned. The labor inspector and the Regional Director shall effect immediate compliance by the employer with the labor standards violated. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "13.  If the issue involves inter-union disputes, the conciliator shall exert all efforts to enable the parties to settle the issue either through voluntary recognition or consent election. Otherwise, the conciliator shall immediately inform the Regional Director or BLR Director, as the case may be, in order that a Med-Arbiter can be directed to resolve the case within a period of five (5) days.\n",
      "14.  It shall be the duty of the conciliator to record in the minutes every point of agreement as well as the unresolved issues. Referrals or representation cases and labor standards violations, including those that are grievable under the CBA, shall be duly noted in the minutes of the conference. The conciliator shall actively monitor the progress and developments on these cases with concerned labor officials.\n",
      "PICKETING\n",
      "15.  During strikes, workers enjoy the right to peaceful picketing which is the marching to and fro before the premises of an establishment involved in a labor dispute, generally accompanied by the carrying and display of signs, placards or banners with statements relating to the dispute. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "16.  The right to peaceful picketing shall be exercised by the workers with due respect for the rights of others. No person engaged in picketing shall commit any act of violence, coercion or intimidation. Stationary picket and the use of means like placing of objects to constitute permanent blockade or to effectively close points of entry or exit in company premises are prohibited by law.\n",
      "INJUNCTION\n",
      "17.  No court or entity shall enjoin any picketing, strike or lockout except as provided in Articles 218 and 263 of the Labor Code, as amended. The National Labor Relations Commission proper shall have the power to issue temporary injunctions but only after due notice and hearing and in accordance with its rules. It may also issue restraining orders to appropriate cases subject as a general rule to the requirements of due notice and hearing.\n",
      "18.  Petitions for injunctions or restraining orders shall be handled or resolved with extreme care and caution. All efforts to conciliate or settle amicably the issues in the main dispute and those involved in petitions for injunctions shall be exhausted. Injunction and restraining orders therefore may be issued only in case of extreme necessity based on legal grounds clearly established, after due consultations or hearing and when all efforts at conciliation are exhausted. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "19.  Injunction orders shall be enforced only to the extent necessary to correct violations of law and shall not prevent the workers exercising the right to peaceful picketing. The right to ingress or egress may be exercised only for lawful purposes as may be indicated in the injunctive orders or in line with established jurisprudence.\n",
      "20.  Injunction orders issued under Article 218 and 263 of the Labor Code, as amended shall be served and enforced by appropriate officials or employees of the National Labor Relations Commission or by such officials or employees of the Department of Labor and Employment who may be designated by the labor secretary.\n",
      "21.  The assistance of other civilian authorities like national, local or city officials may be sought, if necessary. Only under extreme circumstances shall the assistance of the PC/INP be enlisted and in such cases, the police authorities shall only serve on a supportive capacity to labor department officials or employees. All efforts must be exerted in all cases to bring about a voluntary and peaceful compliance with injunctive orders. PC/INP representatives shall be guided by duly promulgated guidelines. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "RETURN TO WORK ORDERS\n",
      "22.  The power to issue assumption and certification orders is an extraordinary authority granted to the President or the Secretary of Labor, the exercise of which shall be strictly limited to national interest cases. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "23.  The issuance of assumption or certification orders automatically enjoins the intended or impending strike or lockout and if one has already taken place, all striking or locked-out employees shall immediately return to work and the employers shall immediately resume operations and re-admit all workers under the same terms and conditions prevailing before the strike or lockout. Assumption and certification orders are executory in character and shall be strictly complied with by the parties even during the pendency of any petition questioning their validity.\n",
      "24.  In case of noncompliance with return-to-work orders, in connection with the certification and assumption of jurisdiction by the Secretary of Labor, the party concerned may be subjected to the sanctions provided by law. Employers who refuse to re-admit returning workers may be liable, upon filing of proper petition, for the payment of wages and other benefits from the date of actual refusal until the workers are re-admitted. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "REMEDIES\n",
      "25.  A strike or lockout may be declared illegal if any of the requirements for a valid strike of lockout is not complied with or if declared based on non-strikable, or when the issues involved are already the subject of arbitration. During a strike or lockout, either of the parties are additionally prohibited from committing illegal acts.\n",
      "26.  The employer or the union may file the proper petition to the appropriate Arbitration Branch of the NLRC to seek declaration of the illegality of the strike or lockout subject to the provision of Article 263(g). It shall be the duty of the Labor Arbiter concerned to act on the case immediately and dispose of the same subject only to the requirements of due process. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "27.  If a strike is declared to be illegal, the employer may be authorized to terminate the employment of union officials who knowingly participate in the illegal strike and any worker or union officer who knowingly participates in the commission of illegal acts during the strike or lockout.\n",
      "28.  In case of an illegal lockout, any worker whose employment has been terminated as a consequence thereof, shall be reinstated with payment of full backwages and other benefits.\n",

      "  GUIDELINES FOR THE CONDUCT OF INP/AFP PERSONNEL DURING STRIKES, LOCKOUTS AND LABOR DISPUTES IN GENERAL.\n",
      " \n",
      "In order to promote public interest and safety, industrial peace and stability, and peace and order, the following guidelines are hereby prescribed to govern the official conduct of all members of the Integrated National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (INP/AFP) during strikes, lockouts and labor disputes in general:chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "GENERAL POLICY\n",
      "1.  It is the essence of these guidelines that labor disputes are within the sole jurisdiction of the Department of Labor and Employment while matters involving peace and war, as well as national security are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of National Defense: but as labor disputes have peace and order implications, close coordination between the two departments is necessary.\n",
      "2.  The involvement of the INP/AFP during strikes, lockouts, and labor disputes in general shall be limited to the maintenance of peace and order, enforcement of laws and legal orders of duly constituted authorities and the performance of specific functions as may be provided by law. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "3.  Whenever the assistance of the INP/AFP is necessary, elements of the police force should first be called upon to render assistance. It is only when the services of the police force are not available or inadequate that the Commanding General, Capital Command (CAPCOM), or the Commander, Metropolitan District Command (METRODISCOM) in the case of cities or the Police Superintendent in the case of provinces or cities not under a METRODISCOM, may call upon elements of the Philippine Constabulary to render assistance. Unless directed by the President or personally by the Secretary of National Defense upon consultation with the Secretary of Labor and Employment or when requested by the latter, personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force shall not intervene more be utilized in any labor dispute.\n",
      "4.  Insofar as practicable, no personnel shall be allowed to render services in connection with a strike or lockout if he is related by affinity or consanguinity within the fourth civil degree to any official/leader of the parties in the controversy or has any financial or pecuniary interest therein. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "5.  A peace-keeping detail shall be established in a strike or lockout area when requested by DOLE or as the Commanding General, CAPCOM, METRODISCOM Commander/Police Superintendent, may deem necessary for the purpose of maintaining peace and order in the area.\n",
      "6.  Personnel detailed as peace-keeping force in strike or lockout areas shall be in uniform, with proper namecloth at all times. He shall observe strict neutrality in his dealings with both parties to the controversy, bearing in mind that the parties to the labor dispute are not his adversaries but his partners in the quest for industrial peace and human dignity. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "PEACE-KEEPING DETAILS\n",
      "7.  The peace-keeping details shall not be stationed in the picket (or confrontation line) but should be stationed such that their presence may deter the commission of criminal acts from either side. The members of the peace-keeping detail shall maintain themselves outside a 50-meter radius from the picket line, except, if the 50-meter radius includes a public thoroughfare, they may station themselves in such public thoroughfare for the purpose of insuring the free flow of traffic. \n",

      "The agrarian reform program is founded on the right of farmers and regular farm workers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other farm workers, to receive a share of the fruits thereof. To this end, the State shall encourage the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to the priorities and retention limits set forth in this Act, having taken into account ecological, developmental, and equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation. The State shall respect the right of small landowners and shall provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing.\n",

      "  ART. 2. Date of effectivity. - This Code shall take effect six (6) months after its promulgation.\n",
      "ART. 3. Declaration of basic policy. - The State shall afford protection to labor, promote full employment, ensure equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race or creed and regulate the relations between workers and employers. The State shall assure the rights of workers to self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure, and just and humane conditions of work.\n",
      "  ART. 4. Construction in favor of labor. - All doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor.\n",
      "ART. 5. Rules and regulations. - The Department of Labor and other government agencies charged with the administration and enforcement of this Code or any of its parts shall promulgate the necessary implementing rules and regulations. Such rules and regulations shall become effective fifteen (15) days after announcement of their adoption in newspapers of general circulation.\n",
      "ART. 6. Applicability. - All rights and benefits granted to workers under this Code shall, except as may otherwise be provided herein, apply alike to all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural. (As amended by Presidential Decree No. 570-A, November 1, 1974).\n",
      "  Chapter II\n",
      "EMANCIPATION OF TENANTS\n",
      "  ART. 7. Statement of Objectives. â€“ Inasmuch as the old concept of land ownership by a few has spawned valid and legitimate grievances that gave rise to violent conflict and social tension and the redress of such legitimate grievances being one of the fundamental objectives of the New Society, it has become imperative to start reformation with the emancipation of the tiller of the soil from his bondage.\n",
      "  ART. 8. Transfer of lands to tenant-workers. - Being a vital part of the labor force, tenant-farmers on private agricultural lands primarily devoted to rice and corn under a system of share crop or lease tenancy whether classified as landed estate or not shall be deemed owner of a portion constituting a family-size farm of five (5) hectares, if not irrigated and three (3) hectares, if irrigated.\n",
      "  In all cases, the land owner may retain a n area of not more than seven (7) hectares if such landowner is cultivating such area or will now cultivate it.\n",
      "ART. 9. Determination of land value. - For the purpose of determining the cost of the land to be transferred to the tenant-farmer, the value of the land shall be equivalent to two and one-half (2-1/2) times the average harvest of three (3) normal crop years immediately preceding the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 27 on October 21, 1972.\n",
      "The total cost of the land, including interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum, shall be paid by the tenant in fifteen (15) years of fifteen (15) equal annual amortizations.\n",
      "In case of default, the amortization due shall be paid by the farmersâ€™ cooperative in which the defaulting tenant-farmer is a member, with the cooperative having a right of recourse against him.\n",
      "The government shall guarantee such amortizations with shares of stock in government-owned and government-controlled corporations.\n",
      "ART. 10. Conditions of ownership. - No title to the land acquired by the tenant-farmer under Presidential Decree No. 27 shall be actually issued to him unless and until he has become a full-fledged member of a duly recognized farmersâ€™ cooperative.\n",
      "Title to the land acquired pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27 or the Land Reform Program of the Government shall not be transferable except by hereditary succession or to the Government in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 27, the Code of Agrarian Reforms and other existing laws and regulations.\n",
      " ART. 11. Implementing agency. - The Department of Agrarian Reform shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this Chapter.\n",

      "WHEREAS, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights (June 1993) and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women (September 1995) reaffirm the equal rights and inherent human dignity of women and men, and particularly the human rights of women as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n",
      "WHEREAS, the Philippines, with other States of the World, has reaffirmed, through the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, its solemn commitment to fulfill its obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law;\n",
      "WHEREAS, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stresses that all forms of sexual harassment are incomparable with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated by legal measures and through national action, while the Beijing Platform for Action specifically mandates Governments to “enact and/or reinforce penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress” violence against women including sexual harassment and “develop programmes and procedures to eliminate sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women in all educational institutions, workplaces and elsewhere;”\n",
      "WHEREAS, the Philippine Congress enacted on February 14, 1995, Republic Act No. 7877, otherwise known as the “Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995”, which took effect on March 5, 1995 and declares unlawful sexual harassment against women and men in the employment, education and training environment.\n",
      "WHEREAS, Section 4 (a) of Republic Act No. 7877 mandates every employer or head of agency in the public and private sectors to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing the procedure for the investigation of sexual harassment cases and the administrative sanctions therefor;\n",

      "WHEREAS, Section 4 of Republic Act NO. 6713 provides norms of personal conduct for public officials and employees to observe in the performance of official duties, and specifically directs that they shall act without discrimination against anyone, and shall at all times respect the rights of others and refrain from doing acts contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy, public order, public safety and public interest;\n",
      "WHEREAS, sexual harassment violates the dignity of workers and their right to humane, just and safe work environment, defeats and impairs morale and efficiency in the workplace, and violates the merit and fitness principle in the civil service.\n",
