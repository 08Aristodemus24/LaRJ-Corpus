The amount of such payment shall be for the benefit of the person entitled to the proceeds of the execution, unless the execution has been fully satisfied, in which event such proceeds shall be for the benefit of the losing party. When a purchaser refuses to pay, the sheriff may thereafter reject any subsequent bid of such person. chan robles virtual law library\n",
      "SECTION 5. Prevailing Party as Purchaser. — When the purchaser is the prevailing party, and no third-party claim has been filed, he need not pay the amount of the bid if it does not exceed the amount of the judgment. If it does, he shall pay only the excess.\n",
