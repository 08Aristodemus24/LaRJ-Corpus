Where necessary, in addition to the above enumeration, each Member may define the line of division which separates industry from commerce and agriculture.Article 21. The whole of the staff employed in any industrial undertaking, public or private, or in any branch thereof shall, except as otherwise provided for by the following Articles, enjoy in every period of seven days a period of rest comprising at least twenty-four consecutive hours.2.

Each Member will draw up a list of the exceptions made under Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention and will communicate it to the International Labour Office, and thereafter in every second year any modifications of this list which shall have been made.2. The International Labour Office will present a report on this subject to the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation.Article 7In order to facilitate the application of the provisions of this Convention, each employer, director, or manager, shall be obliged--(a) where the weekly rest is given to the whole of the staff collectively, to make known such days and hours of collective rest by means of notices posted conspicuously in the establishment or any other convenient place, or in any other manner approved by the Government;(b) where the rest period is not granted to the whole of the staff collectively, to make known, by means of a roster drawn up in accordance with the method approved by the legislation of the country, or by a regulation of the competent authority, the workers or employees subject to a special system of rest, and to indicate that system.Article 8The formal ratifications of this Convention, under the conditions set forth in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 91.

Thereafter, the Convention shall come into force for any Member at the date on which its ratification has been registered with the International Labour Office.Article 10As soon as the ratifications of two Members of the International Labour Organisation have been registered with the International Labour Office, the Director-General of the International Labour Office shall so notify all the Members of the International Labour Organisation. He shall likewise notify them of the registration of the ratifications which may be communicated subsequently by other Members of the Organisation.Article 11Each Member which ratifies this Convention agrees to bring the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 into operation not later than 1 January 1924 and to take such action as may be necessary to make these provisions effective.Article 12Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention engages to apply it to its colonies, possessions and protectorates, in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.Article 13A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered with the International Labour Office.Article 14At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 15The French and English texts of this Convention shall both be authentic.|| \n",

      "|| Preamble The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Montreal by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Twenty-ninth Session on 19 September 1946, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to medical examination for fitness for employment in non-industrial occupations of children and young persons, which is included in the third item on the agenda of the Session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this ninth day of October of the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-six the following Convention, which may be cited as the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Non-Industrial Occupations) Convention, 1946:PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 11. This Convention applies to children and young persons employed for wages, or working directly or indirectly for gain, in non-industrial occupations.2. For the purpose of this Convention, the term non-industrial occupations includes all occupations other than those recognised by the competent authority as industrial, agricultural and maritime occupations.3. The competent authority shall define the line of division which separates non-industrial occupations from industrial, agricultural and maritime occupations.4. National laws or regulations may exempt from the application of this Convention employment, on work which is recognised as not being dangerous to the health of children or young persons, in family undertakings in which only parents and their children or wards are employed.Article 21. Children and young persons under eighteen years of age shall not be admitted to employment or work in non-industrial occupations unless they have been found fit for the work in question by a thorough medical examination.2. The medical examination for fitness for employment shall be carried out by a qualified physician approved by the competent authority and shall be certified either by a medical certificate or by an endorsement on the work permit or in the workbook.3. The document certifying fitness for employment may be issued-- (a) subject to specified conditions of employment;(b) for a specified job or for a group of jobs or occupations involving similar health risks which have been classified as a group by the authority responsible for the enforcement of the laws and regulations concerning medical examinations for fitness for employment.4. National laws or regulations shall specify the authority competent to issue the document certifying fitness for employment and shall define the conditions to be observed in drawing up and issuing the document.Article 31. The fitness of a child or young person for the employment in which he is engaged shall be subject to medical supervision until he has attained the age of eighteen years.2. The continued employment of a child or young person under eighteen years of age shall be subject to the repetition of medical examinations at intervals of not more than one year.3. National laws or regulations shall-- (a) make provision for the special circumstances in which a medical re-examination shall be required in addition to the annual examination or at more frequent intervals in order to ensure effective supervision in respect of the risks involved in the occupation and of the state of health of the child or young person as shown by previous examinations; or(b) empower the competent authority to require medical re-examinations in exceptional cases.Article 41. In occupations which involve high health risks medical examination and re-examinations for fitness for employment shall be required until at least the age of twenty-one years.2. National laws or regulations shall either specify, or empower an appropriate authority to specify, the occupations or categories of occupations in which medical examination and re-examinations for fitness for employment shall be required until at least the age of twenty-one years.Article 5The medical examinations required by the preceding articles shall not involve the child or young person, or his parents, in any expense.Article 61. Appropriate measures shall be taken by the competent authority for vocational guidance and physical and vocational rehabilitation of children and young persons found by medical examination to be unsuited to certain types of work or to have physical handicaps or limitations.2. The nature and extent of such measures shall be determined by the competent authority; for this purpose co-operation shall be established between the labour, health, educational and social services concerned, and effective liaison shall be maintained between these services in order to carry out such measures.3. National laws or regulations may provide for the issue to children and young persons whose fitness for employment is not clearly determined-- (a) of temporary work permits or medical certificates valid for a limited period at the expiration of which the young worker will be required to undergo re-examination;(b) of permits or certificates requiring special conditions of employment.Article 71. The employer shall be required to file and keep available to labour inspectors either the medical certificate for fitness for employment or the work permit or workbook showing that there are no medical objections to the employment as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations.2. National laws or regulations shall determine-- (a) the measures of identification to be adopted for ensuring the application of the system of medical examination for fitness for employment to children and young persons engaged either on their own account or on account of their parents in itinerant trading or in any other occupation carried on in the streets or in places to which the public have access; and(b) the other methods of supervision to be adopted for ensuring the strict enforcement of the Convention.PART II. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN COUNTRIESArticle 81. In the case of a Member the territory of which includes large areas where, by reason of the sparseness of the population or the stage of development of the area, the competent authority considers it impracticable to enforce the provisions of this Convention, the authority may exempt such areas from the application of the Convention either generally or with such exceptions in respect of particular undertakings or occupations as it thinks fit.2. Each Member shall indicate in its first annual report upon the application of this Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any areas in respect of which it proposes to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article and no Member shall, after the date of its first annual report, have recourse to the provisions of the present Article except in respect of areas so indicated.3. Each Member having recourse to the provisions of the present Article shall indicate in subsequent annual reports any areas in respect of which it renounces the right to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article.Article 91. Any Member which, before the date of the adoption of the laws or regulations permitting the ratification of this Convention, had no laws or regulations concerning medical examination for fitness for employment of young persons in non-industrial occupations may, by a declaration accompanying its ratification, substitute an age lower than eighteen years, but in no case lower than sixteen years, for the age of eighteen years prescribed in Articles 2 and 3 and an age lower than twenty-one years, but in no case lower than nineteen years, for the age of twenty-one years prescribed in Article 4.2. Any Member which has made such a declaration may at any time cancel the declaration by a subsequent declaration.3. Every Member for which a declaration made in virtue of paragraph 1 of this Article is in force shall indicate each year in its annual report upon the application of this Convention the extent to which any progress has been made with a view to the full application of the provisions of the Convention.PART III. FINAL ARTICLESArticle 10Nothing in this Convention shall affect any law, award, custom or agreement between employers and workers which ensures more favourable conditions than those provided by this Convention.Article 11The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 121. This Convention shall be binding only upon those Members of the International Labour Organisation whose ratifications have been registered with the Director-General.2. It shall come into force twelve months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered with the Director-General.3.

A Member which has ratified this Convention may denounce it after the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Convention first comes into force, by an act communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration. Such denunciation shall not take effect until one year after the date on which it is registered.2. Each Member which has ratified this Convention and which does not, within the year following the expiration of the period of ten years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, exercise the right of denunciation provided for in this Article, will be bound for another period of ten years and, thereafter, may denounce this Convention at the expiration of each period of ten years under the terms provided for in this Article.Article 141. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall notify all Members of the International Labour Organisation of the registration of all ratifications and denunciations communicated to him by the Members of the Organisation.2. When notifying the Members of the Organisation of the registration of the second ratification communicated to him, the Director-General shall draw the attention of the Members of the Organisation to the date upon which the Convention will come into force.Article 15The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of all ratifications and acts of denunciation registered by him in accordance with the provisions of the preceding articles.Article 16At such times as it may consider necessary the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in whole or in part.Article 171. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this Convention in whole or in part, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides, (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 13 above, if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 18The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally authoritative.|| \n",

      "|| Preamble The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its Thirtieth Session on 19 June 1947, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to the organisation of labour inspection in industry and commerce, which is the fourth item on the agenda of the Session, andHaving determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention,adopts this eleventh day of July of the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-seven the following Convention, which may be cited as the Labour Inspection Convention, 1947:PART I. LABOUR INSPECTION IN INDUSTRYArticle 1Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this Convention is in force shall maintain a system of labour inspection in industrial workplaces.Article 21. The system of labour inspection in industrial workplaces shall apply to all workplaces in respect of which legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work are enforceable by labour inspectors.2. National laws or regulations may exempt mining and transport undertakings or parts of such undertakings from the application of this Convention.Article 31. The functions of the system of labour inspection shall be: (a) to secure the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work, such as provisions relating to hours, wages, safety, health and welfare, the employment of children and young persons, and other connected matters, in so far as such provisions are enforceable by labour inspectors;(b) to supply technical information and advice to employers and workers concerning the most effective means of complying with the legal provisions;(c) to bring to the notice of the competent authority defects or abuses not specifically covered by existing legal provisions.2. Any further duties which may be entrusted to labour inspectors shall not be such as to interfere with the effective discharge of their primary duties or to prejudice in any way the authority and impartiality which are necessary to inspectors in their relations with employers and workers.Article 41. So far as is compatible with the administrative practice of the Member, labour inspection shall be placed under the supervision and control of a central authority.2. In the case of a federal State, the term central authority may mean either a federal authority or a central authority of a federated unit.Article 5The competent authority shall make appropriate arrangements to promote:(a) effective co-operation between the inspection services and other Government services and public or private institutions engaged in similar activities; and(b) collaboration between officials of the labour inspectorate and employers and workers or their organisations.Article 6The inspection staff shall be composed of public officials whose status and conditions of service are such that they are assured of stability of employment and are independent of changes of government and of improper external influences.Article 71. Subject to any conditions for recruitment to the public service which may be prescribed by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors shall be recruited with sole regard to their qualifications for the performance of their duties.2. The means of ascertaining such qualifications shall be determined by the competent authority.3. Labour inspectors shall be adequately trained for the performance of their duties.Article 8Both men and women shall be eligible for appointment to the inspection staff; where necessary, special duties may be assigned to men and women inspectors.Article 9Each Member shall take the necessary measures to ensure that duly qualified technical experts and specialists, including specialists in medicine, engineering, electricity and chemistry, are associated in the work of inspection, in such manner as may be deemed most appropriate under national conditions, for the purpose of securing the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to the protection of the health and safety of workers while engaged in their work and of investigating the effects of processes, materials and methods of work on the health and safety of workers.Article 10The number of labour inspectors shall be sufficient to secure the effective discharge of the duties of the inspectorate and shall be determined with due regard for:(a) the importance of the duties which inspectors have to perform, in particular-- (i) the number, nature, size and situation of the workplaces liable to inspection;(ii) the number and classes of workers employed in such workplaces; and(iii) the number and complexity of the legal provisions to be enforced;(b) the material means placed at the disposal of the inspectors; and(c) the practical conditions under which visits of inspection must be carried out in order to be effective.Article 111. The competent authority shall make the necessary arrangements to furnish labour inspectors with-- (a) local offices, suitably equipped in accordance with the requirements of the service, and accessible to all persons concerned;(b) the transport facilities necessary for the performance of their duties in cases where suitable public facilities do not exist.2. The competent authority shall make the necessary arrangements to reimburse to labour inspectors any travelling and incidental expenses which may be necessary for the performance of their duties.Article 121. Labour inspectors provided with proper credentials shall be empowered: (a) to enter freely and without previous notice at any hour of the day or night any workplace liable to inspection;(b) to enter by day any premises which they may have reasonable cause to believe to be liable to inspection; and(c) to carry out any examination, test or enquiry which they may consider necessary in order to satisfy themselves that the legal provisions are being strictly observed, and in particular-- (i) to interrogate, alone or in the presence of witnesses, the employer or the staff of the undertaking on any matters concerning the application of the legal provisions;(ii) to require the production of any books, registers or other documents the keeping of which is prescribed by national laws or regulations relating to conditions of work, in order to see that they are in conformity with the legal provisions, and to copy such documents or make extracts from them;(iii) to enforce the posting of notices required by the legal provisions;(iv) to take or remove for purposes of analysis samples of materials and substances used or handled, subject to the employer or his representative being notified of any samples or substances taken or removed for such purpose.2. On the occasion of an inspection visit, inspectors shall notify the employer or his representative of their presence, unless they consider that such a notification may be prejudicial to the performance of their duties.Article 131. Labour inspectors shall be empowered to take steps with a view to remedying defects observed in plant, layout or working methods which they may have reasonable cause to believe constitute a threat to the health or safety of the workers.2. In order to enable inspectors to take such steps they shall be empowered, subject to any right of appeal to a judicial or administrative authority which may be provided by law, to make or to have made orders requiring-- (a) such alterations to the installation or plant, to be carried out within a specified time limit, as may be necessary to secure compliance with the legal provisions relating to the health or safety of the workers; or(b) measures with immediate executory force in the event of imminent danger to the health or safety of the workers.3. Where the procedure prescribed in paragraph 2 is not compatible with the administrative or judicial practice of the Member, inspectors shall have the right to apply to the competent authority for the issue of orders or for the initiation of measures with immediate executory force.Article 14The labour inspectorate shall be notified of industrial accidents and cases of occupational disease in such cases and in such manner as may be prescribed by national laws or regulations.Article 15Subject to such exceptions as may be made by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors--(a) shall be prohibited from having any direct or indirect interest in the undertakings under their supervision;(b) shall be bound on pain of appropriate penalties or disciplinary measures not to reveal, even after leaving the service, any manufacturing or commercial secrets or working processes which may come to their knowledge in the course of their duties; and(c) shall treat as absolutely confidential the source of any complaint bringing to their notice a defect or breach of legal provisions and shall give no intimation to the employer or his representative that a visit of inspection was made in consequence of the receipt of such a complaint.Article 16Workplaces shall be inspected as often and as thoroughly as is necessary to ensure the effective application of the relevant legal provisions.Article 171. Persons who violate or neglect to observe legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors shall be liable to prompt legal proceedings without previous warning: Provided that exceptions may be made by national laws or regulations in respect of cases in which previous notice to carry out remedial or preventive measures is to be given.2. It shall be left to the discretion of labour inspectors to give warning and advice instead of instituting or recommending proceedings.Article 18Adequate penalties for violations of the legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors and for obstructing labour inspectors in the performance of their duties shall be provided for by national laws or regulations and effectively enforced.Article 191. Labour inspectors or local inspection offices, as the case may be, shall be required to submit to the central inspection authority periodical reports on the results of their inspection activities.2. These reports shall be drawn up in such manner and deal with such subjects as may from time to time be prescribed by the central authority; they shall be submitted at least as frequently as may be prescribed by that authority and in any case not less frequently than once a year.Article 201. The central inspection authority shall publish an annual general report on the work of the inspection services under its control.2. Such annual reports shall be published within a reasonable time after the end of the year to which they relate and in any case within twelve months.3. Copies of the annual reports shall be transmitted to the Director-General of the International Labour Office within a reasonable period after their publication and in any case within three months.Article 21The annual report published by the central inspection authority shall deal with the following and other relevant subjects in so far as they are under the control of the said authority:(a) laws and regulations relevant to the work of the inspection service;(b) staff of the labour inspection service;(c) statistics of workplaces liable to inspection and the number of workers employed therein;(d) statistics of inspection visits;(e) statistics of violations and penalties imposed;(f) statistics of industrial accidents;(g) statistics of occupational diseases.PART II. LABOUR INSPECTION IN COMMERCEArticle 22Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this Part of this Convention is in force shall maintain a system of labour inspection in commercial workplaces.Article 23The system of labour inspection in commercial workplaces shall apply to workplaces in respect of which legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work are enforceable by labour inspectors.Article 24The system of labour inspection in commercial workplaces shall comply with the requirements of Articles 3 to 21 of this Convention in so far as they are applicable.PART III. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONSArticle 251. Any Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention may, by a declaration appended to its ratification, exclude Part II from its acceptance of the Convention.2. Any Member which has made such a declaration may at any time cancel that declaration by a subsequent declaration.3. Every Member for which a declaration made under paragraph 1 of this Article is in force shall indicate each year in its annual report upon the application of this Convention the position of its law and practice in regard to the provisions of Part II of this Convention and the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to the said provisions.Article 26In any case in which it is doubtful whether any undertaking, part or service of an undertaking or workplace is an undertaking, part, service or workplace to which this Convention applies, the question shall be settled by the competent authority.Article 27In this Convention the term legal provisions includes, in addition to laws and regulations, arbitration awards and collective agreements upon which the force of law is conferred and which are enforceable by labour inspectors.Article 28There shall be included in the annual reports to be submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation full information concerning all laws and regulations by which effect is given to the provisions of this Convention.Article 291. In the case of a Member the territory of which includes large areas where, by reason of the sparseness of the population or the stage of development of the area, the competent authority considers it impracticable to enforce the provisions of this Convention, the authority may exempt such areas from the application of this Convention either generally or with such exceptions in respect of particular undertakings or occupations as it thinks fit.2. Each Member shall indicate in its first annual report upon the application of this Convention submitted under Article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation any areas in respect of which it proposes to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article and shall give the reasons for which it proposes to have recourse thereto; no Member shall, after the date of its first annual report, have recourse to the provisions of the present Article except in respect of areas so indicated.3. Each Member having recourse to the provisions of the present Article shall indicate in subsequent annual reports any areas in respect of which it renounces the right to have recourse to the provisions of the present Article.Article 301. In respect of the territories referred to in Article 35 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation as amended by the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation Instrument of Amendment 1946, other than the territories referred to in paragraphs 4 an, 5 of the said Article as so amended, each Member of the Organisation which ratifies this Convention shall communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible after ratification a declaration stating-- (a) the territories in respect of which it undertakes that the provisions of the Convention shall be applied without modification;(b) the territories in respect of which it undertakes that the provisions of the Convention shall be applied subject to modifications, together with details of the said modifications;(c) the territories in respect of which the Convention is inapplicable and in such cases the grounds on which it is inapplicable;(d) the territories in respect of which it reserves its decision.2. The undertakings referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be deemed to be an integral part of the ratification and shall have the force of ratification.3. Any Member may at any time by a subsequent declaration cancel in whole or in part any reservations made in its original declaration in virtue of subparagraphs (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article.4. Any Member may, at any time at which the Convention is subject to denunciation in accordance with the provisions of Article 34, communicate to the Director-General a declaration modifying in any other respect the terms of any former declaration and stating the present position in respect of such territories as it may specify.Article 311. Where the subject matter of this Convention is within the self-governing powers of any non-metropolitan territory, the Member responsible for the international relations of that territory may, in agreement with the Government of the territory, communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a declaration accepting on behalf of the territory the obligations of this Convention.2. A declaration accepting the obligations of this Convention may be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office -- (a) by two or more Members of the Organisation in respect of any territory which is under their joint authority; or(b) by any international authority responsible for the administration of any territory, in virtue of the Charter of the United Nations or otherwise, in respect of any such territory.3.

Injured workmen shall be entitled to the supply and normal renewal, by the employer or insurer, of such artificial limbs and surgical appliances as are recognised to be necessary: provided that national laws or regulations may allow in exceptional circumstances the supply and renewal of such artificial limbs and appliances to be replaced by the award to the injured workman of a sum representing the probable cost of the supply and renewal of such appliances, this sum to be decided at the time when the amount of compensation is settled or revised.2. National laws or regulations shall provide for such supervisory measures as are necessary, either to prevent abuses in connection with the renewal of appliances, or to ensure that the additional compensation is utilised for this purpose.Article 11The national laws or regulations shall make such provision as, having regard to national circumstances, is deemed most suitable for ensuring in all circumstances, in the event of the insolvency of the employer or insurer, the payment of compensation to workmen who suffer personal injury due to industrial accidents, or, in case of death, to their dependants.Article 12The formal ratifications of this Convention, under the conditions set forth in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 131.

LABOUR INSPECTION IN INDUSTRYArticle 1Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this Convention is in force shall maintain a system of labour inspection in industrial workplaces.Article 21. The system of labour inspection in industrial workplaces shall apply to all workplaces in respect of which legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work are enforceable by labour inspectors.2. National laws or regulations may exempt mining and transport undertakings or parts of such undertakings from the application of this Convention.Article 31. The functions of the system of labour inspection shall be: (a) to secure the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work, such as provisions relating to hours, wages, safety, health and welfare, the employment of children and young persons, and other connected matters, in so far as such provisions are enforceable by labour inspectors;(b) to supply technical information and advice to employers and workers concerning the most effective means of complying with the legal provisions;(c) to bring to the notice of the competent authority defects or abuses not specifically covered by existing legal provisions.2. Any further duties which may be entrusted to labour inspectors shall not be such as to interfere with the effective discharge of their primary duties or to prejudice in any way the authority and impartiality which are necessary to inspectors in their relations with employers and workers.Article 41. So far as is compatible with the administrative practice of the Member, labour inspection shall be placed under the supervision and control of a central authority.2. In the case of a federal State, the term central authority may mean either a federal authority or a central authority of a federated unit.Article 5The competent authority shall make appropriate arrangements to promote:(a) effective co-operation between the inspection services and other Government services and public or private institutions engaged in similar activities; and(b) collaboration between officials of the labour inspectorate and employers and workers or their organisations.Article 6The inspection staff shall be composed of public officials whose status and conditions of service are such that they are assured of stability of employment and are independent of changes of government and of improper external influences.Article 71. Subject to any conditions for recruitment to the public service which may be prescribed by national laws or regulations, labour inspectors shall be recruited with sole regard to their qualifications for the performance of their duties.2. The means of ascertaining such qualifications shall be determined by the competent authority.3. Labour inspectors shall be adequately trained for the performance of their duties.Article 8Both men and women shall be eligible for appointment to the inspection staff; where necessary, special duties may be assigned to men and women inspectors.Article 9Each Member shall take the necessary measures to ensure that duly qualified technical experts and specialists, including specialists in medicine, engineering, electricity and chemistry, are associated in the work of inspection, in such manner as may be deemed most appropriate under national conditions, for the purpose of securing the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to the protection of the health and safety of workers while engaged in their work and of investigating the effects of processes, materials and methods of work on the health and safety of workers.Article 10The number of labour inspectors shall be sufficient to secure the effective discharge of the duties of the inspectorate and shall be determined with due regard for:(a) the importance of the duties which inspectors have to perform, in particular-- (i) the number, nature, size and situation of the workplaces liable to inspection;(ii) the number and classes of workers employed in such workplaces; and(iii) the number and complexity of the legal provisions to be enforced;(b) the material means placed at the disposal of the inspectors; and(c) the practical conditions under which visits of inspection must be carried out in order to be effective.Article 111.

COMMON PROVISIONSArticle 69A benefit to which a person protected would otherwise be entitled in compliance with any of Parts II to X of this Convention may be suspended to such extent as may be prescribed--(a) as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the Member;(b) as long as the person concerned is maintained at public expense, or at the expense of a social security institution or service, subject to any portion of the benefit in excess of the value of such maintenance being granted to the dependants of the beneficiary;(c) as long as the person concerned is in receipt of another social security cash benefit, other than a family benefit, and during any period in respect of which he is indemnified for the contingency by a third party, subject to the part of the benefit which is suspended not exceeding the other benefit or the indemnity by a third party;(d) where the person concerned has made a fraudulent claim;(e) where the contingency has been caused by a criminal offence committed by the person concerned;(f) where the contingency has been caused by the wilful misconduct of the person concerned;(g) in appropriate cases, where the person concerned neglects to make use of the medical or rehabilitation services placed at his disposal or fails to comply with rules prescribed for verifying the occurrence or continuance of the contingency or for the conduct of beneficiaries;(h) in the case of unemployment benefit, where the person concerned has failed to make use of the employment services placed at his disposal;(i) in the case of unemployment benefit, where the person concerned has lost his employment as a direct result of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute, or has left it voluntarily without just cause; and(j) in the case of survivors' benefit, as long as the widow is living with a man as his wife.Article 701. Every claimant shall have a right of appeal in case of refusal of the benefit or complaint as to its quality or quantity.2. Where in the application of this Convention a Government department responsible to a legislature is entrusted with the administration of medical care, the right of appeal provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article may be replaced by a right to have a complaint concerning the refusal of medical care or the quality of the care received investigated by the appropriate authority.3. Where a claim is settled by a special tribunal established to deal with social security questions and on which the persons protected are represented, no right of appeal shall be required.Article 711. The cost of the benefits provided in compliance with this Convention and the cost of the administration of such benefits shall be borne collectively by way of insurance contributions or taxation or both in a manner which avoids hardship to persons of small means and takes into account the economic situation of the Member and of the classes of persons protected.2. The total of the insurance contributions borne by the employees protected shall not exceed 50 per cent. of the total of the financial resources allocated to the protection of employees and their wives and children. For the purpose of ascertaining whether this condition is fulfilled, all the benefits provided by the Member in compliance with this Convention, except family benefit and, if provided by a special branch, employment injury benefit, may be taken together.3. The Member shall accept general responsibility for the due provision of the benefits provided in compliance with this Convention, and shall take all measures required for this purpose; it shall ensure, where appropriate, that the necessary actuarial studies and calculations concerning financial equilibrium are made periodically and, in any event, prior to any change in benefits, the rate of insurance contributions, or the taxes allocated to covering the contingencies in question.Article 721. Where the administration is not entrusted to an institution regulated by the public authorities or to a Government department responsible to a legislature, representatives of the persons protected shall participate in the management, or be associated therewith in a consultative capacity, under prescribed conditions; national laws or regulations may likewise decide as to the participation of representatives of employers and of the public authorities.2.

The laws and regulations as to workmen's compensation shall apply to workmen, employees and apprentices employed by any enterprise, undertaking or establishment of whatsoever nature, whether public or private.2. It shall nevertheless be open to any Member to make such exceptions in its national legislation as it deems necessary in respect of-- (a) persons whose employment is of a casual nature and who are employed otherwise than for the purpose of the employer's trade or business;(b) out-workers;(c) members of the employer's family who work exclusively on his behalf and who live in his house;(d) non-manual workers whose remuneration exceeds a limit to be determined by national laws or regulations.Article 3This Convention shall not apply to--(1) seamen and fishermen for whom provision shall be made by a later Convention;(2) persons covered by some special scheme, the terms of which are not less favourable than those of this Convention.Article 4This Convention shall not apply to agriculture, in respect of which the Convention concerning workmen's compensation in agriculture adopted by the International Labour Conference at its Third Session remains in force.Article 5The compensation payable to the injured workman, or his dependants, where permanent incapacity or death results from the injury, shall be paid in the form of periodical payments; provided that it may be wholly or partially paid in a lump sum, if the competent authority is satisfied that it will be properly utilised.Article 6In case of incapacity, compensation shall be paid not later than as from the fifth day after the accident, whether it be payable by the employer, the accident insurance institution, or the sickness insurance institution concerned.Article 7In cases where the injury results in incapacity of such a nature that the injured workman must have the constant help of another person, additional compensation shall be provided.Article 8The national laws or regulations shall prescribe such measures of supervision and methods of review as are deemed necessary.Article 9Injured workmen shall be entitled to medical aid and to such surgical and pharmaceutical aid as is recognised to be necessary in consequence of accidents. The cost of such aid shall be defrayed either by the employer, by accident insurance institutions, or by sickness or invalidity insurance institutions.Article 101. Injured workmen shall be entitled to the supply and normal renewal, by the employer or insurer, of such artificial limbs and surgical appliances as are recognised to be necessary: provided that national laws or regulations may allow in exceptional circumstances the supply and renewal of such artificial limbs and appliances to be replaced by the award to the injured workman of a sum representing the probable cost of the supply and renewal of such appliances, this sum to be decided at the time when the amount of compensation is settled or revised.2. National laws or regulations shall provide for such supervisory measures as are necessary, either to prevent abuses in connection with the renewal of appliances, or to ensure that the additional compensation is utilised for this purpose.Article 11The national laws or regulations shall make such provision as, having regard to national circumstances, is deemed most suitable for ensuring in all circumstances, in the event of the insolvency of the employer or insurer, the payment of compensation to workmen who suffer personal injury due to industrial accidents, or, in case of death, to their dependants.Article 12The formal ratifications of this Convention, under the conditions set forth in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, shall be communicated to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for registration.Article 131.
