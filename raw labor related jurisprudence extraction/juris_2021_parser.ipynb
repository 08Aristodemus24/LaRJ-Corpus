      "Impeachment is a constitutional process that takes place within the political departments of our government. The House of Representatives accuses and the Senate, sitting as an Impeachment Court, decides. Public opinion, as well as the facts established by the evidence and the grounds and processes prescribed by the basic law, steer and weigh heavily in the formulation of its outcome. Nevertheless, the pervasive realm of the courts that is judicial review is retained as to any act within the limits of discretion provided by the Constitution.[1]Upon a judgment of ouster by the impeachment court, however, some of its ramifications spring from a gray area in law. One such vagueness lies in the monetary entitlements of the public officer, who reached the legal age of retirement after his removal but died shortly thereafter without the separate charges filed against him having been resolved with finality. While retirement laws are interpreted liberally in favor of the retiree,[2] the rare peculiarities of certain cases smoke out a legal gap that only legislature can address. The law beckons construction and construction becomes unnecessary without a law. Justice, nonetheless, shall not be denied by the courts to the deserving. Equity is the ink that writes the law and not its inverse.Before the Court is the supplication for the grant of post-employment and survivorship benefits of Ma. Cristina Roco Corona (Mrs. Corona), as the spouse of former Chief Justice Renato C. Corona.The AntecedentsRenato Coronado Corona became the Chief Justice of the Philippines on May 12, 2010 after an eight-year stint as Associate Justice in the High Court. He occupied the judicial apex very momentarily: a year after his appointment as Chief Justice, Articles of Impeachment were filed against him and he was eventually indicted by the House of Representatives under Section 2, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution[3] on the alleged grounds of betrayal of public trust, culpable violation of the Constitution, and graft and corruption.The lower House's formal accusations against Chief Justice Corona read as follows:GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENTRespondent betrayed the Public Trust, committed Culpable Violation of the Constitution and Graft and Corruption in the following manner:ARTICLE IRESPONDENT BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST THROUGH HIS TRACK RECORD MARKED BY PARTIALITY AND SUBSERVIENCE IN CASES INVOLVING THE ARROYO ADMINISTRATION FROM THE TIME OF HIS APPOINTMENT AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND UNTIL HIS DUBIOUS APPOINTMENT AS A MIDNIGHT CHIEF JUSTICE TO THE PRESENT.ARTICLE IIRESPONDENT COMMITTED CULPABLE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND/OR BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST WHEN HE FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO THE PUBLIC HIS STATEMENT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND NET WORTH AS REQUIRED UNDER SEC. 17, ART. XI OF THE 1987 CONSTITUTION.ARTICLE IIIRESPONDENT COMMITTED CULPABLE VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND/OR BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST BY FAILING TO MEET AND OBSERVE THE STRINGENT STANDARDS UNDER ART. VIII, SECTION 7 (3) OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH PROVIDES THAT \"[A] MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY MUST BE A PERSON OF PROVEN COMPETENCE, INTEGRITY, PROBITY, AND INDEPENDENCE\" IN ALLOWING THE SUPREME COURT TO ACT ON MERE LETTERS FILED BY A COUNSEL WHICH CAUSED THE ISSUANCE OF FLIP-FLOPPING DECISIONS IN FINAL AND EXECUTORY CASES; IN CREATING AN EXCESSIVE ENTANGLEMENT WITH MRS. ARROYO THROUGH HER APPOINTMENT OF HIS WIFE TO OFFICE; AND IN DISCUSSING WITH LITIGANTS REGARDING CASES PENDING BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.ARTICLE IVRESPONDENT BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST AND/OR COMMITTED CULPABLE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION WHEN HE BLATANTLY DISREGARDED THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS BY ISSUING A \"STATUS QUO ANTE\" ORDER AGAINST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CASE CONCERNING THE IMPEACHMENT OF THEN OMBUDSMAN MERCEDITAS NAVARRO-GUTIERREZ.ARTICLE VRESPONDENT BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST THROUGH WANTON ARBITRARINESS AND PARTIALITY IN CONSISTENTLY DISREGARDING THE PRINCIPLE OF RES JUDICATA IN THE CASES INVOLVING THE 16 NEWLY-CREATED CITIES, AND THE PROMOTION OF DINAGAT ISLAND INTO A PROVINCE.ARTICLE VIRESPONDENT BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST BY ARROGATING UNTO HIMSELF, AND TO A COMMITTEE HE CREATED, THE AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION TO IMPROPERLY INVESTIGATE A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXCULPATING HIM. SUCH AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION IS PROPERLY REPOSED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES VIA IMPEACHMENT.ARTICLE VIIRESPONDENT BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST THROUGH HIS PARTIALITY IN GRANTING A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER (TRO) IN FAVOR OF FORMER PRESIDENT GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO AND HER HUSBAND JOSE MIGUEL ARROYO IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE PROSECUTION AND TO FRUSTRATE THE ENDS OF JUSTICE, AND IN DISTORTING THE SUPREME COURT DECISION ON THE EFFECTIVITY OF THE TRO IN VIEW OF A CLEAR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S OWN TRO.ARTICLE VIIIRESPONDENT BETRAYED THE PUBLIC TRUST AND/OR COMMITTED GRAFT AND CORRUPTION WHEN HE FAILED AND REFUSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE JUDICIARY DEVELOPMENT FUND (JDF) AND SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FOR THE JUDICIARY (SAJ) COLLECTIONS.[4]After a heavily-publicized trial, the Senate declared Chief Justice Corona unfit to hold such a lofty position and removed him from his office due mainly to his act of non-declaration of his Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN). The Senate, sitting as an impeachment court, so declared in its final judgment on May 29, 2012:The SENATE sitting as an Impeachment Court, having tried Renato S. Corona, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, upon three Articles of Impeachment charged against him by the House of Representatives, by a guilty vote of 20 Senators, representing at least two-thirds of all the Members of the SENATE, has found him guilty of the charge under Article II of the said Articles of Impeachment: Now, therefore, be itADJUDGED, That Renato C. Corona be, and is hereby, CONVICTED of the charge against him in Article II of the Articles of Impeachment.WHEREFORE, in accordance with Article XI, Section 3(7) of the Constitution, the penalty of removal from office and disqualification to hold any office under the Republic of the Philippines is hereby imposed upon respondent Chief Justice Renato C. Corona.[5]No objection or a motion for reconsideration was interposed against the judgment of the Senate. Having been dishonorably stripped of his public office and having undergone a most difficult and stressful trial, the Chief Justice's health quickly deteriorated culminating to his death on April 29, 2016. The separate criminal charges for graft and corruption then pending before the Sandiganbayan, as well as the tax evasion and forfeiture cases, were all necessarily dismissed in view of the Chief Justice's demise.The widow of the Chief Justice, Mrs. Corona, now pleads for judicial benevolence.In a letter dated July 13, 2020 now docketed as A.M. No. 20-07-10-SC, Mrs. Corona asserts, albeit unseeking of its reversal, that the Senate judgment removing the Chief Justice from office should be voided for insufficiency of evidence and noncompliance with Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution.Citing the scholarly views of Father Joaquin G. Bernas (Fr. Bemas), Mrs. Corona insists that her late spouse's ouster by impeachment merely divested him of his political capacity as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Thus, she prays that she be allowed to reap the retirement benefits and other gratuities provided under Sections 1 and 3 of Republic Act No. 9946 (RA 9946), and monthly survivorship pension under Administrative Circular No. 81-2010 (AC 81-2010). She believes that the late Chief Justice is entitled to these benefits, having toiled for more than 20 years in public service until he was unseated at age 63. She also cites the previous acts of judicial benevolence accorded to a number of Supreme Court magistrates and implores for a similar treatment.Mrs. Corona further claims that her prayer for monetary reliefs have already been impliedly granted in view of the issuance of clearances by the section heads of the Supreme Court's administrative arm and her receipt of her husband's monetized accrued leave credits, all in accordance with the Court's September 3, 2019 Resolution in A.M. No. 19-09-02-SC.The matter was then referred to the Office of the Chief Attorney (OCAt) for its report and evaluation.In a Report dated September 28, 2020, the OCAt shared Mrs. Corona's opinion that a verdict in an impeachment case has the sole effect of ousting the errant official from his/her post.Its concurrence with Mrs. Corona, however, ended there. In its interpretation of Sections 1 and 3 of RA 9946, the OCAt submits that it will be a stretch to consider former Chief Justice Corona's removal by impeachment tantamount to an act of resignation by reason of incapacity to discharge the duties of the office that he held. While forfeiture of retirement benefits is not expressly included as a penalty in a judgment on an impeachment proceeding, the OCAt posits that the gap be left as it is and referred to legislative discretion. For lack of supporting legal basis, the OCAt recommended the denial of Mrs. Corona's claims for the release of her late husband's retirement benefits and survivorship pension.The matter is now before this Court for resolution.IssueRipe for judicial determination is the question of whether retirement benefits, other gratuities, and survivorship pension should be accorded to Mrs. Corona as the spouse of the late Chief Justice Corona despite the latter's ouster by impeachment.Our RulingThe Court grants the plea of Chief Justice Corona's widow.The effects of a judgment on animpeachment complaint extendsno further than to removal fromoffice and disqualification fromholding any public office.Impeachment was conceived as part of the system of checks and balances in the Constitution of the United States of America.[6] In the debates in the Constitutional Convention, the delegates aimed to craft a mechanism that would allow for the discipline of a President who abused his constitutional responsibilities without creating a weapon by which the President would be prevented from carrying them out.[7] The ultimate goal was to refine and make effective the separation of powers.[8]The delegates eventually crafted Article II, Section 4 of the US Constitution, which states that the President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States can be impeached. The phrase \"all civil Officers of the United States\" encompasses the judges.[9] Article I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7 provides for the repercussions of a judgment of impeachment within their jurisdiction:The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.\"[10]Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\"[11] (Emphasis supplied.)When criminal penalties were excluded from the impeachment process, the Framers of the US Constitution departed from the English system, which incorporated provisions for criminal sanctions.[12] Article II, Section 4 only stated that the impeached official \"shall be removed from Office\" upon conviction.[13] Article I, Section 3 also provided that \"[j]udgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.\"[14]Nixon v. United States[15] and similar string of American jurisprudence,[16] confirmed this mutual exclusivity of impeachment proceedings and court trial. It was declared therein:There are two additional reasons why the Judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments. First, the Framers recognized that most likely there would be two sets of proceedings for individuals who commit impeachable offenses-the impeachment trial and a separate criminal trial. In fact, the Constitution explicitly provides for two separate proceedings, x x x The Framers deliberately separated the two forums to avoid raising the specter of bias and to ensure independent judgments:Would it be proper that the persons, who had disposed of his fame and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, should in another trial, for the same offence, be also the disposers of his life and his fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that error in the first sentence would be the parent of error in the second sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights, which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision? (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied.)By sharply distinguishing a criminal prosecution from an impeachment, the Framers had made it clear that impeachment is not the means intended to redress and punish offenses against the state, but rather a mere political safeguard designed to preserve the state and its system of laws from internal harm. [17] Precisely, it was not crafted to mete out punishment.[18]In the same vein, impeachment does not imply immunity from court processes, nor does it preclude other forms of discipline.In United States v. Isaacs,[19] the argument of the respondent judge therein that \"the provisions of Articles I and II of the Constitution relating to impeachment provide the only means of removing a judge from office, and, because conviction on criminal charges is tantamount to removal from office, federal courts are without jurisdiction over the person,\" was summarily rejected. The US Court of Appeals ruled that \"[t]he [US] Constitution does not forbid the trial of a federal judge for criminal offenses committed either before or after his or her assumption of judicial office. Art. I, § 3, cl. 7, declaring that an impeached person is \"subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law\", does not cloak the person with immunity from indictment prior to or after being impeached.Relevantly, it was decreed in Nixon v. Sirica,[20] that \"[b]y contemplating the possibility of post-impeachment trials for violations of law committed in office, the Impeachment Clause itself reveals that incumbency does not relieve the [impeachable officer] of the routine legal obligations that confine all citizens, x x x The legality of judicial orders should not be confused with the legal consequences of their breach; for the courts in this country always assume that their orders will be obeyed, especially when addressed to responsible government officials.\"Owing to our country's intertwined history with US expansionism in the Orient in the 19th century, our own basic law is worded and interpreted not too differently from that of the US as regards impeachment of public officers.The 1935 Philippine Constitution:ARTICLE IX. - IMPEACHMENTSECTION 1. The President, the Vice-President, the Justices of the Supreme Court, and the Auditor General, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribeiy, or other high crimes.x x x xSEC. 4. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the Government of the Philippines, but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to prosecution, trial, and punishment, according to law.

      "Men never plan to be failures;they simply fail to plan to besuccessful.~ William Arthur WardWe resolve an appeal from the Decision[1] of the Sandiganbayan dated March 15, 2019 in Crim. Case No. SB-ll-CRM-0120 finding accused-appellant Antonio M. Talaue guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 52(g) in relation to Section 6(b) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8291.Talaue and his co-accused, Efren C. Guiyab and Florante A. Galasinao, were charged with said violation in an Information which reads:That on or about 01 March 2006, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Sto. Tomas, Isabela, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, public officers, being then the Municipal Mayor, the Municipal Treasurer, and the Municipal Accountant, respectively, and as such has (sic) the legal obligation to timely remit to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) the GSIS premium contributions of the employees of the Municipal Government of Sto. Tomas, Isabela[,] did there and then willfully, unlawfully, and criminally, fail to remit the said GSIS premiums, with an aggregate amount of Php22,436,546.10, for the period 01 January 1997 to 31 January 2004 within thirty (30) days from the date on which payment thereof has become due and demandable, to the damage and prejudice of the municipal employees.CONTRARY TO LAW.[2]The facts, as culled from the Sandiganbayan Decision, are as follows:On April 19, 2018, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the case against accused Guiyab, pursuant to Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code upon his demise on 22 March 2018.During trial, the prosecution presented the Branch Manager of GSIS Cauayan, Isabela Branch, Araceli A. Santos. In her Judicial Affidavit, she stated that she started working with the GSIS in 1983 up to the present. Pursuant to a subpoena from the Office of the Ombudsman, in relation to the criminal case filed against the accused public officers of the Municipality of Sto. Tomas, Isabela pertaining to the non-remittance of the employees' mandatory premium contributions to the GSIS, she coordinated with their Billing and Collection Unit and requested a copy of the Statement of Account of said municipality. She, likewise, prepared a Cover Letter with attached Notice on Past Due Compulsory Premiums dated October 27, 2016 covering the period 01 January 1997 to 31 December 2005, and a file of collection letters/notices of default sent to said municipality. Based on the documents she prepared and a Memorandum of Agreement between the GSIS and the municipality dated November 19, 2008, Santos stated that the municipal government failed to remit the total amount of P22,436,546.10, inclusive of interests.Santos also testified that the head of the agency, the treasurer, and the accountant are the persons with legal obligation to remit the contributions to the GSIS, because the head of the agency approves the disbursements, the treasurer has actual possession of the funds, and the accountant ensures that there are funds available. She also averred that the notices and demand letters are addressed to the municipality, through the Mayor, who should be the one to explain the matter.On its part, the defense presented accused Galasinao, erstwhile Acting Municipal Treasurer and the Municipal Accountant from 1993 to 2017 of the Municipal Government of Sto. Tomas. In his Judicial Affidavit, Galasinao stated that as Municipal Accountant, he was tasked to check and endorse the necessary documentation relative to the expenses of the Municipality, which includes the employees' payroll and the corresponding disbursement voucher.Accused Galasinao claimed that he was not mandated by law to remit the GSIS contributions of the municipal employees and that his participation is allegedly limited to computing the necessary and compulsory deductions from an employee's monthly salary and preparing the necessary disbursement vouchers, expenditure reports, and other related documents for the GSIS contributions and remittances. He claimed that his participation stops when he endorses the documents to the Municipal Treasurer for payment because it is the latter who has the duty to safekeep, allocate, disburse, and manage the municipality's funds. In this case, the Municipal Treasurer was accused Guiyab who had already passed away during the pendency of the case.Accused Galasinao also testified that he does not have proof that he had prepared and endorsed the documents relative to the GSIS contribution remittances for the period January 1997 to January 2004 because the same were lost and destroyed when Typhoon Jack struck Isabela sometime in October 2010.Moreover, accused Galasinao alleged that a Decision by the Pasay City Regional Trial Court approving the MOA entered into by the GSIS and the municipal government was endorsed to him in order to reconcile the records of both parties. He also mentioned that based on Paragraph 5.1 of Article 5 of the MOA, the total or restructured obligation in the agreement assumed by the municipal government is not to be treated as a loan granted to the municipality, and not unpaid contributions or remittances to the GSIS. Paragraph 6.4 of Article VI likewise provides that the MOA replaces and supersedes any understanding, communication and representation, whether verbal or written, between the parties. / /Accused Galasinao stated that he then prepared the necessary documentation for these alleged expenses and forwarded the same to the municipal treasurer for payment, while waiting for communication from the GSIS regarding the reconciliation of records and data. However, these documents were also destroyed by the typhoon.On cross-examination, accused Galasinao admitted that the contributions of the employees to the GSIS which he deducted from their salaries were not actually remitted to the GSIS. However, he gave no answer when he was asked why the contributions were not remitted. He claimed that his duty ended when he forwarded the payroll to the municipal treasurer.Galasinao also affirmed that he knows that the GSIS has the right to terminate the MOA with the Municipal Government of Sto. Tomas in the event of default on the part of the latter.The defense then presented appellant Talaue who served as Municipal Mayor from 1988 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2010. In his Judicial Affidavit[3] dated June 27, 2018, appellant mentioned that with regard to the charge that he failed to remit the GSIS contributions of the municipal employees for the period of January 1997 to January 2004, he claimed that he was the municipal mayor only from January 1997 to June 1998 and from June 2001 to January 2004.Appellant testified that he came to know of a decrease of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) from the municipality's budget when they received it in 1997 from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). He claimed that the DBM used to withhold a certain portion of the municipality's annual budget to be applied as payments to government agencies, including the GSIS. He alleged that he gave instructions that an inquiry be made with the DBM to clarify if the decrease pertains to the amount regularly withheld by the DBM. The DBM allegedly informed them that there may have been errors in the computation and release of the municipality's budget for 1997, and that it no longer withheld any amount in the previous years.Appellant averred that he gave further instructions to follow-up with the DBM to correct the irregularities in the municipality's budget in order to allegedly comply with their obligations. He also claimed that he instructed the municipal treasurer, accused Guiyab, to make arrangements for the payment of the municipality's regular remittances, including the GSIS, as the DMBM no longer withholds and makes the remittances for them starting 1997.According to appellant, the municipal treasurer told him that the municipality is running short of funds due to other legitimate expenditures because it was the end of the year, and that they thought that the DBM was the one responsible for withholding and paying on the municipality's behalf the necessary remittances to the GSIS.Appellant asserted that it is the municipal treasurer who is primarily responsible for the payment of the municipality's obligations, including the GSIS contributions, because he is the municipality's disbursing officer. He claimed that he reiterated his instructions to the municipal treasurer to make arrangements with the DBM. During this time, however, his term as municipal mayor ended.When he was elected again in 2001, appellant found out that the municipal treasurer has not made arrangements for the payment of the municipality's obligations to the GSIS, including the period when he stepped down from office. Hence, he instructed the municipal treasurer to make arrangements with the GSIS regarding the settlement of the obligations of the municipality, and to reconcile their records with the GSIS. However, appellant claimed that no formal arrangements were made and that the accounts remained unreconciled until January 2004.Appellant narrated that in 2006, the GSIS sued him, his co-accused, and the Municipality of Sto. Tomas for collection of sum of money before the Pasay City Regional Trial Court Branch 118 docketed as Civil Case No. 06-0407-CFM relative to the municipality's obligations to the GSIS. While the case was pending, appellant allegedly told the municipal treasurer to start paying the GSIS. He claimed that funds were allocated for that purpose and payments were made to the GSIS. He identified GSIS Official Receipt No. 0002237669[4] dated August 28, 2007 in the amount of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00,) which was acknowledged by the GSIS under Official Receipt No. 30366 dated October 11, 2007 and Official Receipt No. 524548 in the amount of Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P850,000.00). He also mentioned that the parties eventually entered into a MOA and the court issued a Decision[5] approving the same on January 7, 2009. The GSIS filed a Motion for Execution[6] dated October 6, 2010 and the Regional Trial Court issued a Writ of Execution[7] through an Order dated March 31,2011.Appellant maintains that he is not criminally liable because Paragraph 5.1 of the MOA provides that the total or restructured obligation of the municipality to the GSIS is now to be treated as a loan, and not an unpaid obligation, which is to be paid on a scheduled basis and subject to the reconciliation of accounts and data. Moreover, Paragraph 6.4 of Article VI likewise provides that the MOA replaces and supersedes any understanding, communication and representation, whether verbal or written, between the parties. Appellant claims that an outstanding loan cannot be a basis for any criminal liability.On cross-examination, appellant testified that he does not have any document to prove the alleged decrease in their budget in 2007 in the amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00). He claimed that he only instructed the municipal treasurer to communicate with the DBM and the GSIS, and reconcile the amounts which the municipality owes to the GSIS. Appellant also provided no proof of the instructions he allegedly gave to the municipal treasurer. There was no written order of the same. With regard to the reconciliation of the records, he claimed that the instruction was made in writing, but the same was destroyed by the typhoon.The defense likewise presented Araceli Santos who had earlier testified for the prosecution. She testified that the remitting agency is the municipal employees of Sto. Tomas, Isabela, and that the subject official receipts represent partial payments of the arrearages of the agency to the GSIS. On cross-examination, she confirmed that despite the official receipts presented by the defense, the Notice of Past Due Compulsory Premiums in 2016 which she signed provides that the Municipality of Sto. Tomas still owes the GSIS P22,436,546.10.The Sandiganbayan acquitted accused Galasinao on reasonable doubt but found herein appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. The dispositive portion of its Decision dated March 15, 2019 reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Antonio M. Talaue GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 52(g) in relation to Section 6(b) of Republic Act No. 8291. He is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from three (3) years[,] as minimumf,] to five (5) years[,] as maximum, and to pay a fine of Twenty Thousand Pesos (Php20,000.00). He shall further suffer the penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification from holding public office and from practicing any profession or calling licensed by the Government.Accused Florante A. Galasinao, on the other hand, is hereby ACQUITTED on reasonable doubt. The property or cash bonds posted by accused Galasinao for his provisional liberty is ordered returned, subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. The Hold Departure Order issued against him is ordered LIFTED.SO ORDERED.[8]On appeal to this Court, appellant assigned the following errors in his Brief:The Sandiganbayan committed grave reversible error:I. In holding that the mere act of failing to remit GSIS contributions is criminally punishable. Although the offense charged is malum prohibitum, jurisprudence x x x says that intent to perpetrate the act must be proved.II. In not finding that the failure to remit the GSIS contributions was not intentional, and in holding, against the established facts, that appellant Talaue \"did nothing\" to settle the Municipality's GSIS obligations.III. In convicting Talaue, simply because he was the head of office, and in ignoring the steps he took to settle the Municipality's obligations as well as the Municipality's financially straitened circumstances.IV. In not applying the Arias doctrine.V. In imposing the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office, which accused-appellant challenges as unconstitutional, as the law imposes the same regardless of the absence of mens rea.[9]For its part, the People, through the Office of the Special Prosecutor, argue that appellant availed of the wrong mode of appeal under the Sandiganbayan Law and the Rules of Court, and that the period to appeal has thus lapsed, rendering the judgment of conviction final and immutable. Further, even assuming that appellant availed of the correct mode of appeal, the People argue that the Sandiganbayan correctly found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of the crime charged, and that the rulings in Arias v. Sandiganbayan[10] and Magsuci v. Sandiganbayan[11] are not applicable.In summary, the issues brought on appeal are whether appellant availed of the correct mode of appeal, and whether he is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.Anent the first issue, there appears to be some confusion as to whether the mode of appeal in Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1606, as amended by R.A. Nos. 7975 and 8249, or the mode of appeal in the 2018 Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan, will apply to appeals of criminal cases from the Sandiganbayan in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. A study of the legislative history of these statutes is apropos.Prior to the amendment of P.D. No. 1606, the Sandiganbayan had jurisdiction over (a) violations of R.A. No. 3019, as amended, otherwise, known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and R.A. No. 1379; (b) crimes committed by public officers and employees, including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporations, embraced in Title VII of the Revised Penal Code, whether simple or complexed with other crimes; and (c) other crimes or offenses committed by public officers or employees, including those employed in government-owned or -controlled corporations, in relation to their office. This jurisdiction was original and exclusive if the offense charged was punishable by a penalty higher than prision correccional, or its equivalent, except as provided in P.D. No. 1606. In other offenses, the jurisdiction was concurrent with the regular courts.In 1995, Congress enacted R.A. No. 7975 in order for the Sandiganbayan to concentrate on the \"larger fish\" and leave the \"small fry\" to the lower courts, the larger fish referring to public officials whose salary grades were at grade \"27\" or higher and over certain public officials holding important positions in government regardless of salary grade as specifically enumerated in Section 4, and the small fry referring to public officials whose salary grades were at grade \"26\" or lower and not falling under the aforementioned enumeration.[12]Hence, Congress limited the jurisdict\n",

      "Before us is a Complaint for Disbarment[1] filed by Lance Peter Dillon (Dillon) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) seeking to disbar the respondent Atty. Napoleon C. De Quiroz (Atty. De Quiroz), for allegedly violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).The facts are as follows.Complainant maintains that in April 2014, he engaged the services of the respondent to represent him in Criminal Case No. 469594-CR for Falsification of a Public Document he filed against one Anna Maria Mapili (Mapili) before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Manila, Branch 9. The complainant made an initial payment upon engagement and additional payments for court appearances, but according to the latter, the respondent failed to issue a single receipt for moneys received. According to the complainant, respondent has committed several lapses in handling the aforementioned criminal case as the latter repeatedly failed to communicate with him regarding the status of the case. In addition, it was alleged that the respondent failed to answer the complainant's email and the respondent failed to attend a court hearing on November 6, 2014. Likewise, the complainant averred that the respondent falsified the Judicial Affidavit[2] (JA) of the complainant which was submitted in the aforementioned case.Subsequently, the complainant lost in the criminal case he filed against Mapili. As a result, he instituted the present case against the respondent for gross incompetence and extreme negligence.Meanwhile, the respondent in his defense, denies the accusations of the complainant. He asserts that he never disregarded the rights of the complainant nor has he committed repeated and continued procedural failures. Further, he claimed that he exercised honesty, integrity and trustworthiness in all dealings with the complainant in relation to Criminal Case No. 469594-CR. Moreover, the respondent was the fourth (4th) law office to handle the said criminal case since the information was filed before the MeTC Branch 9 in Manila on November 12, 2012.According to the respondent, on May 6, 2014, he, together with his fiancee, Ms. Debbie Saturno, met with the complainant for the first time at Horizon Plaza Hotel in Madaluyong City, where he was introduced to him by Ms. Haidelisa Husmillo (Ms. Husmillo), Director of First Magellan Overseas Corporation. At that time, complainant needed a lawyer to attend a scheduled hearing on May 8, 2014 of his case against Mapili pending before the MeTC, Branch 9 in Manila. After the complainant gave a brief background of the said criminal case, the respondent appraised him of his rights and explained to him the court procedure, the causes of actions in relation to the case and the probable period of trial, among others. Thereafter, the parties entered and signed a Contract of Legal Services[3] and complainant likewise signed the Entry of Appearance[4] for the respondent. An acceptance fee of Forty Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00) was paid by the complainant thru Ms. Husmillo. The respondent gave the corresponding receipt to Ms. Husmillo.Further, the respondent maintains that the complainant was present during the hearing on May 8, 2014 when the Presiding Judge, Hon. Yolanda M. Leonardo (Judge Leonardo), ordered the referral of the case to the Philippine Mediation Center and set the pre-trial/preliminary conference on July 24, 2014. A photocopy of the said Order[5] was given to the complainant by the respondent. Also, the respondent sent an email dated June 11, 2014 to the complainant reminding him of the pre-trial/preliminary conference on July 24, 2014. However, despite notice, the complainant did not attend the hearing on July 24, 2014 and only the respondent was present. In an email dated August 13,2014, respondent informed the complainant that during the hearing on July 24, 2014, Judge Leonardo set the case for Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) on August 5, 2014. Again, the complainant failed to attend the JDR on the said date. Thus, the same was reset to August 26, 2014.Later on, respondent, thru email, informed the complainant of the scheduled JDR and requested that complainant send a Special Power of Attorney[6] (SPA) authorizing the former to represent the latter in the case. For failure of the complainant to appear and to send the SPA to the respondent, the JDR on August 26, 2014 was terminated and the case was set for trial on November 6, 2014. On November 6, 2014, respondent admits that he failed to attend the scheduled hearing as he was not feeling well. However, the respondent sent his secretary to inform the court. The court then directed the prosecution to submit the JA of the complainant within fifteen (15) days. On November 8,2016, complainant and respondent began discussing the contents of the JA. On November 24, 2014, respondent sent an email to the complainant for the latter to sign his JA. However, since complainant was no longer around and the JA had to be filed on November 24, 2014, respondent submitted the JA of the complainant which he signed on behalf of the complainant.On the same day, respondent sent to the complainant, thru email, a copy of his JA as filed with the court. Complainant was unhappy with the JA filed by the respondent and so on December 16, 2014, thru an email, complainant terminated the services of the respondent. On January 15, 2015, complainant, thru another email, requested the respondent to file his formal withdrawal in the said criminal case. Likewise, the complainant extended his gratitude to the respondent for helping him with his case. On February 5, 2015, respondent filed with the MeTC, Branch 9 in Manila, his Withdrawal of Appearance which was noted by the court in an Order[7] dated February 16, 2015. On September 28, 2015, respondent received an email from the complainant informing him that his case was dismissed and that he will file a complaint against Judge Leonardo with the Ombudsman and will seek her dismissal together with the fiscal. Complainant also threatened to file a complaint for disbarment against the respondent and Atty. Agdon, the lawyer who took over the case. Lastly, complainant demanded that the respondent return all expenses he incurred totaling to One Hundred Ninety-Six Thousand Pesos (PI96,000.00), file an appeal immediately, and commence and prosecute a civil action against Mapili entirely at respondent's cost. For the respondent, the action of the complainant constitutes blackmail and extortion.On June 28, 2016, respondent filed his Pre-Trial Brief.[8] Later, on July 1, 2016, a Mandatory Conference was held attended only by the respondent. An Order was then issued giving the complainant an addition period of ten (10) days within which to submit his mandatory conference brief and, likewise, directed the parties to submit their verified position papers.On August 1, 2016, the IBP-CBD received the complainant's Mandatory Conference Brief.[9] On the other hand, the respondent filed his Verified Position Paper[10] with supporting documents, while the complainant submitted his Position Paper[11] on August 15, 2016. On October 12, 2016, an Order[12] was issued directing the respondent to submit the missing annexes to his Position Paper and ordering him to furnish the complainant all annexes to his Position Paper. Later on, the respondent filed his compliance on December 22, 2016.Upon a thorough evaluation of the evidence presented by the parties in their respective pleadings, the IBP-CBD submitted its Report and Recommendation[13] dated January 30, 2017 finding Atty. De Quiroz to have fallen short of the standards required of him as private prosecutor in Criminal Case No. 469594. Thus, the IBP Investigating Commissioner found Atty. De Quiroz administratively liable for violating the basic rule of signing the JA for and in behalf of his client without the requisite authority to do so and recommended that he be meted the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for three (3) months.In a Resolution[14] dated November 29, 2017, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP-BOG) resolved to adopt the findings of fact and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner, with modification, to reduce the recommended penalty of suspension from the practice of law to one (1) month, there being no bad faith on the part of the respondent and it being his first offense. Atty. De Quiroz moved for partial reconsideration stating that he was fully authorized by the complainant to sign the JA through an SPA the latter executed and signed in favor of the former. However, the reconsideration was denied by the IBP Board of Governors through a Notice of Resolution[15] dated June 18, 2019.On March 12, 2020, the IBP-CBD transmitted to the Court the Notices of Resolution and records of the case for appropriate action.The Issue Before the CourtThe essential issue in this case is whether or not respondent should be held administratively liable for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility when he signed the JA for and in behalf of his client without the requisite authority to do so.Our RulingAfter a judicious review of the instant case, this Court reverses the ruling of the IBP-BOG.In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Further, the complainant has the burden of proving by substantial evidence the allegations in his complaint. The basic rule is that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof. Charges based on mere suspicion and speculation likewise cannot be given credence.[16] In the present case, there is no sufficient, clear and convincing evidence to hold Atty. De Quiroz administratively liable for violating the Code of Conduct in handling the case for the complainant to be liable for disbarment.It is notable that the Investigating Commissioner, in her report and recommendation, concluded that, based from the submissions of the complainant, he never had full trust in his lawyers calling them incompetent. The respondent was the fourth lawyer/firm to handle the case of the complainant. The delay, if any, and the eventual loss of the case is not entirely the respondent's fault. This Court agrees with this particular findings of the Investigating Commissioner.In the present case, the complainant alleged that the respondent lowered the standards of the legal profession and failed to notify and apprise him of the legal processes. However, it is clearly established, based from the findings of fact of the IBP-CBD, that the respondent constantly apprised the complainant of the status of the case thru emails and attended to the case of the complainant with due care and diligence. The charge of deceit, falsehood or falsification against the respondent has never been clearly established nor supported by concrete evidence. The only issue in this case is whether or not the respondent violated the basic rule of signing the JA for and in behalf of his client without the requisite authority to do so.This Court disagrees with the findings of the Investigating Commissioner that the respondent signed the JA for and in behalf of his client without the requisite authority to do so. The respondent was fully authorized by the complainant through an SPA[17] he executed and signed in favor of the respondent. The said SPA was attached and annexed with the JA and was also attached with the respondent's position paper. A perusal of the SPA would show that the respondent was authorized to sign in behalf of the complainant and was given full power and authority to do and perform every act and thing whatsoever requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises. Thus, the finding of the Investigating Commissioner that the respondent is liable of signing the JA for and in behalf of his client without the requisite authority is of no moment.Further, the respondent signed the JA of the complainant in due reliance with the above-mentioned SPA. The complainant did not even bother to contest the subject SPA in all his pleadings before the IBP. The actions of the complainant clearly denote that he had given the full authority in favor of the respondent to sign and file the disputed JA.Now, the electronic mail[18] sent on September 28, 2015 by the complainant to the respondent calls our attention. It is apparent from the said electronic mail that the complainant did not just threaten the respondent but also the other lawyer who handled his case. He also threatened to seek the dismissal of Judge Leonardo and the Fiscal assigned to the case. To quote the complainant, he explicitly said that: \"I am going to blacken names and reputations. What have I got to lose? \" The explicit display of this conduct only means that he will come after those who are involved in his case which is very alarming. He simply cannot accept that he lost a case and as a result he will go a long way to blacken the names and reputation of those that are involved.Likewise contained in the above-mentioned electronic mail, the complainant expressly belittled the judicial system of the Philippines. Notable also is the fact that the complainant gave the respondent some options to avoid the filing of a disbarment case, such as: (a) refunding the forty-six thousand pesos (P46,000.00) he paid the respondent, plus the cost of three (3) visits to the Philippines which is one hundred fifty thousand pesos (P150,000.00), or (b) file an appeal immediately, within the prescribed period to file, or (c) commence and prosecute a civil action against Mapili entirely at the respondent's cost, expecting to claim four million pesos (P4,000,000.00) in damages. Such conditions are borderline blackmail and extortion which are uncalled for.In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that complainant Dillon did not present substantial evidence to show that herein respondent violated the CPR. In fact, the instant case is simply evident of the complainant's frustration and dissatisfaction with the outcome of the case which the respondent handled. While the Court will not avoid its responsibility in meting out the proper disciplinary punishment upon lawyers who fail to live up to their sworn duties, the Court will not wield its axe against those accusations against whom are not indubitably proven.[19] Much less in this case where the accusations are obviously baseless.WHEREFORE, the Complaint for Disbarment against Atty.

      "PER CURIAM:\n",
      "This administrative case stemmed from the March 21, 2018 Memorandum[1] of Eduardo G. Tesea, Team Leader of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Financial Audit Team (Audit Team) of the Fiscal Monitoring Division (FMD), Court Management Office (CMO) to Court Administrator Jose Midas P. Marquez charging Eden P. Rosare (Rosare), Clerk of Court II, Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Labo, Camarines Norte of: (a) violation of OCA Circular No. 13-92 dated March 1, 1992[2] as amended by Supreme Court (SC) Administrative Circular (A.C.) No. 3-00 dated June 15, 2000[3] and OCA Circular No. 50-95 dated October 11, 1995[4]; (b) Gross Dishonesty; and (c) Malversation of Public Funds or Property.[5]The Team conducted two audits on the accountabilities of Rosare as Clerk of Court II of MTC, Labo, Camarines Norte (MTC Labo) from November 2014 to February 28,2017 in compliance with Travel Order No. 126-2014 dated November 4, 2014[6] and Travel Order No. 23-2017 dated February 24, 2017[7].In November 2014, the Audit Team conducted an audit[8] of the cash and accounts of Rosare due to her failure to submit the monthly financial reports despite due notice as required by OCA Circular No. 32-93[9] dated July 9, 1993. The audit disclosed that Rosare's cash on hand in the amount of P154,080.00 did not correspond with the unremitted or undeposited collections on all funds in the amount of P222,484.00.The audit also revealed that Rosare delayed the deposit of her judiciary fund collections in the total amount of P222,484.00 which resulted in a shortage of P68,404.00. However, after arduous effort to find the shortage of P68,404.00, Rosare found a portion of it in the drawer next to her table which eventually reduced the shortage on the Fiduciary Fund (FF) and the Sheriffs Trust Fund (STF) to PI,000.00 each and on the Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF)toP3,168.10.Rosare likewise failed to deposit her collections within the day or the next banking day contrary to the provisions of the Commission on Audit and Department of Finance (COA-DOF) Joint Circular 1-81 dated January 1, 1981[10], OCA Circular No. 13-92 dated March 1, 199211 and SC A.C. No. 3-00 dated June 15, 2000[12]. The collections for the FF were also not deposited on time in violation of OCA Circular No. 50-95 dated October 11, 1995[13].Furthermore, Rosare overlooked her task of filing and submitting monthly reports of collections and deposits or withdrawals to the Accounting Division (AD), Financial Management Office (FMO), OCA, as required in OCA Circular 113-04 dated September 16, 2004[14] which provides that monthly reports be sent not later than the 10th day of each succeeding month to the Chief Accountant of the AD, FMO, OCA. She likewise failed to refund several cash bonds in the total amount of P86,000.00 to the bondsmen or to their authorized representatives even when the amount was already withdrawn from the depository bank. Also, Rosare allocated the fees on the solemnization of marriage between the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) and the SAJF which was already disallowed by Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 125-2007 dated August 9, 2007.[15] She also failed to follow OCA Circular No. 22-94 dated April 8, 1994[16] as to the proper handling and use of official receipts.Compounding her failures, Rosare also did not properly update the official cash books by regularly entering therein the daily collections as per SC A.C. No. 3-00 dated June 15, 2000 and to certify the entries therein as correct. She likewise did not use the prescribed cash book on General Fund (GF) account of the Court, which is comprised of forfeited or confiscated bonds and income derived from the interest earned on FF or STF's account. She failed to attach the prescribed Legal Fees Form in all case records as required under OCA Circular No. 26-97 dated May 5, 1997.[17] Finally, the STF collections were erroneously deposited by Rosare in the FF bank account of the court.In a Letter dated November 19, 2014,[18] Rosare was required to explain in writing how and why she incurred the shortages of P1,000 on FF, P1,000 on the STF and P3,168.10 on the SAJF. She was likewise required to deposit the total amount of P222,484.00 corresponding to the unremitted or undeposited collections on various funds; to submit a written explanation why she failed tc deposit the same immediately with the authorized government depositories; and to explain why she incurred a shortage of P68,404.00.

No. 1445[19].Moreover, Rosare was reminded to issue receipts for every STF transaction on a per case basis and reported separately. Immediately after effecting a service of court processes, the sheriff or process server or other authorized court personnel shall prepare a Statement of Liquidation which shall be approved by the Executive Judge or Presiding Judge to be submitted to the Clerk of Court.Presiding Judge Salvador C. Villarosa, Jr. of MTC Labo was requested to assign a court personnel who can assist Rosare in handling financial transactions, particularly in the recording in the cashbook and the preparation of the Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits or Withdrawals, and in issuing receipts and assessment of filing fees.On February 16, 2017, pursuant to the January 23, 2017 Memorandum approved on February 13, 2017 by the Chief Justice, Rosare was relieved from her position as Clerk of Court and her authority to receive, collect and withdraw any court fund was suspended effective immediately.[20]In February 2017,[21] the Audit Team conducted another audit of Rosare's books of accounts for the same reason, that is, failure to submit the monthly financial reports despite due notice. An inventory of the cash on hand in the amount of P23,625.00 and its corresponding official receipts revealed that MTC Labo has not been depositing its daily collections as per circulars issued by the Court. After the audit, the Audit Team found that Rosare had a shortage of P456,470.381, to wit[22]: Name of Fund  Shortage (P)  Fiduciary Fund (FF)  381,894.18  Sheriffs Trust Fund (STF)  41,000.00  Judiciary Development Fund (JDF)  3,842.20  Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF)  4,228.00  Mediation Fund (MF)  25,500.00  General Fund (GF)  6.00  TOTAL  456,470.38 Rosare failed to regularly submit the Monthly Reports of Collections and Deposit or Withdrawals on all funds to the AD, FMO, OCA as per OCA Circular 113-04 dated September 16, 2004. She also did not remit or deposit on a regular basis to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Labo Branch in accordance with COA-DOF Joint Circular 1-81 and in OCA Circular No. 13-92 dated March 1, 1992 as amended by SC A.C. No. 3-2000 dated June 15, 2000.Moreover, Rosare intentionally detached or severed pages 73 and 74 from the FF cashbook for no apparent reason. She also deliberately understated her collections on JDF and SAJF in several instances in January 2017. As to the STF, the applicable rules regarding the liquidation of cash advances made by the process server were not fully complied with.Also, MTC Labo has no official cashbook on the GF account contrary to the rule that each fund account must exclusively use one official cashbook. In addition, certifications as to the correction of entries in the cashbooks on all fund accounts were not regularly observed by Rosare or any accountable officer. Several entries on the triplicate copies of the issued official receipts in FF and STF were not legible. Finally, the recommendations made in the first audit conducted on November 1 to 12, 2014 were not fully complied with by Rosare.In a Letter dated March 23, 2017,[23] the Audit Team recommended that Rosare be directed to: (a) submit all necessary documents to support all unauthorized and unaccounted FF and STF withdrawals in the bank or otherwise restitute the shortages in the amount of P469,464.38 within ten (10) days from notice; (b) explain in writing within ten (10) days from notice why: (i) she incurred such shortages and failed to comply with the Court circulars and issuances regarding proper handling of court collections; (ii) she purposely detached or severed pages 73 and 74 from the FF cashbook; and (iii) she understated her collections for JDF and SAJF in various instances in January 2017; and (c) submit all required financial reports by the AD, FMO, OCA.The Audit Team likewise recommended that Hans P. Camu, the Court Interpreter and Officer-in-Charge, be advised to: (a) deposit or remit all judiciary collections on time; (b) certify the correctness of entries in the cashbooks on all funds; (c) remit all GF collection in the Bureau of Treasury Savings Account No. 3402-2745-13; (d) follow the procedures on proper handling and disbursement of STF account; (e) use the prescribed cash book on GF account; (f) ensure a legible entry in the triplicate copies of official receipts; (g) reconcile the book balance with cash on hand on a daily basis and follow the provision of Chapter 2 (10) of the Cash Examination Manual; (h) remit all GF collections in Bureau of Treasury Savings Account No. 3402-2745-13; and (i) coordinate with the FMO, OCA regarding the requirements on Fidelity Bond in compliance with Section 101 of P.D. No. 1445.In her Explanation dated April 28,2017,[24] Rosare reasoned that she never received the letters of Atty. Gilda A. Sumpo, the Chief Judicial Officer of AD, requiring her to submit monthly or quarterly financial reports on different fund accounts of the court. She claimed that the said letters were received by Lovely Camonas, the Court Stenographer of MTC Labo, who did not turn over said letters to her. She showed the alleged registry receipts to the Audit Team as proof that she mailed the alleged unsubmitted reports required by the FMO.She explained that the shortages on FF or STF were based on the following: (a) the unauthorized or unaccounted FF/STF bank withdrawals in the amount of P213,000.00 referred as bail bonds were withdrawn and received by the bondsmen; (b) the over-withdrawal of interest charged in the amount of P894.18 is not allowed by the LBP; (c) the amount of PI 6,000.00 was no longer deposited because Aida Francisco, the bondsman, withdrew the cash bond on November 26, 2014; (d) the unauthorized STF withdrawals in the total amount of P13,000.00 were not yet accounted for because of missing files; (e) there was no double withdrawal of P3,000.00 on STF because of erroneous input of case numbers; and (f) the portion of the undeposited amount of P144,595.00 was not yet turned over to her for deposit while the rest of the undeposited amount had not yet been accounted for because of missing files.Furthermore, she clarified that the shortages in the STF were due to the following: (a) the undeposited STF collection in the amount of P28,000.00 refers to the cash advance of the process server which was not yet liquidated as there was yet no court order from the presiding judge; (b) the shortage in the amount of P12,000.00 was erroneously deposited in the FF account; and (c) the unsupported bank withdrawal of P1,000.00 was withdrawn on March 26, 2015 for a certain case.Rosare further explained that the shortages on the JDF and the SAFJ in the amounts of P3,842.20 and P4,228.00, respectively, were due to her failure to reconcile the amounts indicated in the official receipts and in the cashbook due to heavy workload. Lastly, Rosare reasoned that the shortage on the MF was due to missing files.She elucidated that she purposely detached or severed pages 73 and 74 from the FF cashbook because of her writings on it, that is, \"GUSTO KO NG MAGPAKAMATAY PAGOD AT HIRAP NA HIRAP NA AKO. SHIT! SHIT! MGA PERWISYO! SORRY IYA!\". She insisted that she did not defy Court circulars and other Court issuances regarding the proper handling of court collections. She maintained that she submitted all the required reports to the AD on time as per the registry receipts she mentioned. She prayed that she be given enough time to locate the missing files. However, she is willing to pay and restitute the unaccounted amounts in case she fails to find them.On March 21, 2018, the Audit Team submitted its Report[25] which found Rosare guilty of violation of A.C. No. 32-93 as amended by A.C. No. 3-2000 and A.C. No. 50-95, Gross Dishonesty and Malversation of Public Funds or Property, for which grounds it recommends that she be dismissed from service with forfeiture of all benefits except her accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to re-employment in the government service.Recommendation of the OCA:In its March 26, 2018 Memorandum[26], the OCA approved the findings and recommendations of the Audit Team, to wit: The report be DOCKETED as a regular administrative complaint against Ms. Eden P. Rosare, Clerk of Court II, MTC, Labo, Camarines Norte and that she be found GUILTY of violation of Administrative Circular No. 32-93 (Re: Collection of Legal Fees and Submission of Monthly Report of Collections) as amended by Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 and Administrative Circular No. 50-95, gross dishonesty and malversation of public funds or property (Article 217, Revised Penal Code) and be DISMISSED from the service effective immediately, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits except her accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or service of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations; The position of Ms. Eden P.

      "This resolves the Petition for Certiorari[1] assailing the Commission on Audit (COA) Decision No. 2016-135[2] dated July 28, 2016 and Resolution No. 2018-33[3] dated July 18, 2018 (assailed issuances). In the assailed issuances, the COA Commission Proper (COA Proper) denied Theo-Pam Trading Corporation (Theo-Pam)'s Money Claim against respondent Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) for the payment of various laboratory chemicals amounting to P2,361,060.00.  The Antecedents  This case stemmed from a Petition[4] filed by Theo-Pam against BPI before the COA Proper for the payment of the latter's obligation amounting to P2,361,060.00 plus interest, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses (Money Claim).  On various dates between May and October 2009, BPI prepared four purchase orders (POs)[5] naming Theo-Pam as the supplier and directing/requesting the latter to furnish BPI various types of chemicals. BPI Director Joel S. Rudinas (BPI Director Rudinas), as the head of the agency, and Susana SG. Gonzalo, OIC, Laboratory Services Division, as the head of the requisitioning office/department (end user), signed and approved the POs. Leonida L. Morales, Budget Officer, also signed the POs and certified them as to the availability of funds for the corresponding transactions.  In turn, Theo-Pam issued wholesale invoices corresponding to each BPI PO, viz.:    PO No. PO Date Invoice No.  Invoice Date  Amount      154-09 May 25, 2009 185906 June 4, 2009 P88,000.00      206-09 June 15, 2009  186335 June 20, 2009  724,600.00      240-09 July 10, 2009 186584 June 29, 2009  240,500.00     397-09 October 2, 2009  189804 October 20, 2009  1,307,960.00             ===========     Outstanding balance due from BPI    P2,361,060.00              ===========       German T. Yatco, National Pesticide Analytical Laboratory (NPAL) Senior Agriculturalist, and Noreen D. Escobar, NPAL Chemist I,[6] affixed their signatures on Wholesale Invoice Nos. 186335 and 186584, respectively, indicating that they have \"[r]eceived the above articles in good order and condition.\"[7]  On May 26, 2010, Theo-Pam informed[8] then BPI Director Dr. Larry R. Lacson (BPI Director Lacson) that it has delivered the aforementioned orders to the end user, NPAL of the BPI Laboratory Services Division. However, it has not yet received any payment for the orders. To \"settle different issues regarding the chemicals and re-agents procured by the [NPAL]\"[9] as detailed in the above-enumerated POs, BPI Director Lacson issued Memorandum Order No. 34,[10] Series of 2010, dated June 21, 2010 forming an Inspection/Verification Team, viz.:   The team is tasked to perform the following functions with the objective of determining whether the subject chemicals where [sic] delivered and consumed by NPAL  Conducts/documents physical inventory of all chemicals and their empty containers delivered to NPAL on the aforementioned POs; Inventory/Review all residue analysis certificates issued relative to the subject chemical purchased; Does interview works [sic] on NPAL staffs [sic] regarding the receipt and use of chemicals.   In another Letter[11] dated June 23, 2010, Theo-Pam, through counsel, reiterated BPI's outstanding balance and demanded BPI to settle its account within five days. Otherwise, Theo-Pam will proceed with the appropriate legal actions. On even date, BPI Director Lacson responded as follows:   This is to acknowledge the receipt of your letter date[d] 23 June 2010 regarding the BPI's outstanding and overdue account in the amount of Two Million Three Hundred Sixty One Thousand and Sixty Pesos (PhP 2,361,060.00)  We would like to assure you that this Office is doing everything to ensure that [Theo-Pam] will get what is due to them without prejudice to the interest of the government.[12]   Subsequently, the Inspection/Verification Team detailed their findings in a Memorandum[13] dated July 9, 2010 (Team Report), viz.:    A. During our ocular inspection in the area where the waste materials/ empty containers of the subject chemicals are stored, the group find [sic] it difficult to identify which of the waste materials/ empty containers (x x x) in the area belong to the subject chemicals and which are not belong [sic] x x x:           x x x x          B. The group reviewed the records of Residue Analysis Certificates issued by the National Pesticide Analytical Laboratory (NPAL) and found out that there is neither name nor amount of chemicals used being indicated in the certificate. The name and amount of chemicals used by the said office can be seen only in their RIS, monthly report and accomplishment report.          C. During our interview with some of the NPAL stuff who are involved either in the receipt, consumption and/ or utilization of the subject chemicals, the said staff categorically denied any ghost delivery x x x and confirmed that the subject chemicals were delivered and the same were used and consumed for their operations. It has been said and affirmed that the subject chemicals were necessary for the analysis of Okra and Mango, otherwise the exportation of said commodities to Japan will be greatly affected. (x x x)       CONCLUSION          While the group found difficulty in determining the delivery and consumption of the subject chemicals on the basis of the Waste Materials and Certificates of Residue Analysis available, yet there are substantial evidences [sic] to prove that such chemicals had been delivered and consumed by the end-user. These evidences [sic] include the Delivery Receipts issued by the supplier (Theo-Pam) as well as the testimonies made by the NPAL Staff who are involved either in the receipt, consumption and/or utilization of the said chemicals. It is worth mentioning however, that if there are lapses committed in the procurement process that led to the delay of the payment, the team believes that such lapses cannot justify the non-payment of the subject chemicals. Therefore, it is respectfully recommended that immediate settlement of this account be made in accordance with the Delivery Receipts issued (x x x), in order to uphold the good relationship with the supplier Theo-Pam, who in one way or the other, help [sic] BPI in extending its technical services to the different stakeholders particularly the exporters by offering/providing chemicals at reasonable prices.[14] (Italics supplied.)    Thereafter, in a Letter[15] dated July 26, 2010, BPI Director Lacson inquired from the COA, through Resident Auditor Adora Rimando, regarding the aforementioned orders, viz.:   Dear Ms. Rimando:  The Bureau of Plant Industry would like to inquire from your Office the best course of action concerning the unpaid chemicals delivered by Theo Pam to the Bureau of Plant Industry. Below are the circumstances which may help your Office in assessing the situation:  That there were deliveries done by Theo-Pam of various chemicals, covered by the approved Purchase Order Nos. 154-09, 206-09, 240-09 and 397-09. Considering the urgency/ necessity of the subject chemicals in their operation, the same were received and accepted in good faith by the end-user, National Pesticide Analytical Laboratory. (x x x) To further attest to the truth of the deliveries, Ms. Noreen D. Escobar and Mr. German Yatco of BPI NPAL submitted a certification appertaining thereto; (x x x)  That there were BAC Resolutions Declaring Single Calculated Responsive Bids for the aforementioned transactions (x x x); Despite of the certification of the BPI Budget Office on the availability of funds to pay the subject PO's, the same remained outstanding due to the refusal of the Property Officer and the BPI Inspector to affix their respective signature on the Inspection Reports because of the alleged failure of the end-user to inform them before using the delivered chemicals; The undersigned in so many times had talked to the persons involved to try to find out the truth and come up with the solutions favorable to the government but fair and just to supplier, since it was established during the February 10, 2010 meeting that there were indeed deliveries; A Team was created under Memorandum Order No. 34, to conduct inventory and verification of the waste materials/ empty containers of the subject chemicals and was also directed to submit a definite findings and conclusion [sic] within 10 working days (x x x). In a report submitted to the Director, the Inventory Team recommended the immediate settlement of the Account in accordance with the Delivery Receipts (x x x).  In view of the aforementioned facts, we are ready to commence the payment of the said chemicals but before that, may we solicit the opinions and recommendations of the Commission on Audit on the legality of paying the deliveries considering the refusal on the part of Property Officer and the Inspector to affix their respective signatures on the Inspection and Acceptance Reports. Can the report of the Team (Memorandum Order No. 34) be used as sufficient document in lieu of the Inspection Report?[16] (Italics supplied.)   On September 6, 2010, Theo-Pam requested an update regarding the COA's recommendation for the subject transactions. In a Letter[17] dated September 13, 2010, BPI Director Clarito M. Barron (BPI Director Barron) expressed that the COA noted lapses in BPI's procurement procedures, viz.:   Ms. Adora Rimando, State Auditor IV of the Commission on Audit, in a letter reply to former BPI Director Larry R. Lacson query dated July 26, 2010 stated that there was a failure to comply with some requirements such as non-notification of the Properly Officer of the deliveries to be accepted and inspected by the BPI's property inspectors. Thus, there are still issues to be resolved regarding the deliveries before any payment can be made to your client.  As soon as the problem is resolved and payment is in order, we will immediately notify your office.[18] (Italics supplied.)   In another Letter[19] dated December 21, 2010, BPI Director Barren informed Theo-Pam as follows:   x x x During our exchange of notes, we already accentuated that [Theo-Pam]'s claim cannot be processed due to some issues still unresolved at this time. We had already looked into this situation and when we examined, the more it is difficult to pinpoint who is responsible or accountable for the release of payments to give their concurrence because of questions which remained unanswered. Please bear in mind that these issues would not have happened if the proper procedures were followed.  Theo Pam Trading has been our partner for over twenty years and we believe that their representative knows the rules to follow but for these deliveries it is unfortunate that they were overlooked. While we do not deny that there is fault on the part of the bureau's officers and personnel, willingly or not, it cannot be denied also that there are lapses on your client's side. Rest assured that we are doing our very best to reconcile our documents to resolve as carefully as possible so that we will not encounter the same particularly in compliance with the Commission on Audit's rules and regulations. x x x[20] (Italics supplied.)   BPI's balance remained outstanding. Thus, on May 3, 2012, Theo-Pam filed its Money Claim before the COA Proper alleging as follows: First, BPI purchased items from them as evidenced by four BPI POs and the corresponding Theo-Pam Wholesale Invoices. Second, Theo-Pam allowed BPI 30 days from the invoice date to pay for the purchase amounts. Third, BPI admitted receiving the orders. Fourth, despite repeated demands, BPI failed to settle its outstanding balance.  In its Answer,[21] BPI, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, mainly denied the actual delivery of the orders. It countered as follows:  First, the aforementioned BPI POs and Theo-Pam Wholesale Invoices do not prove actual delivery. In particular, the wholesale invoices appended to Theo-Pam's Money Claim contained irregularities: (a) there were erasures in relation to the date; (b) it had notations that did not appear on the wholesale invoice copies retained by BPI; and (c) the signature of the personnel who allegedly received the delivery did not match the signature on BPI's file copy of the same invoice.[22]  Second, the subject transactions did not comply with BPI's new procurement process flow (BPI Process Flow) as directed by then BPI Director Rudinas through an office memorandum[23] dated May 28, 2009 addressed to all BPI employees, viz:    (4c) Property   Preparation of Purchase Order    (5a) End User    Preparation of Obligation Request and signing of Division Chief     (5b) Budget   For obligation and signature of Budget Officer   (5c) OD/ADO    Approval of Purchase Order   (6) Property/[Internal Control Unit]    Serving of P.O.Delivery of goods:     - Chemicals/Lab. Equipment (2 days) - Goods (2 days) - Office equipment / Furnitures, etc. (2 days)    Inspection and acceptanceVoucher preparation.[24] (Emphasis supplied.)    Verily, Romansito G. Guerrero, Inspector, BPI Internal Control Unit,[25] prepared Inspection Reports,[26] noting that the deliveries, as reflected on the delivery receipts, corresponded to the POs, as follows:     PO No.  Observations   P.O.# 154-09- Deliveries are equal to the Purchase Order[27]   P.O.#206-09- Deliveries are equal to the Purchase Order[28]    P.O. #240-09  Deliveries are greater than the Purchase Order[29]    P.O. #397-09 Deliveries are not equal to the Purchase Order in terms of greater quantities of ACETONE and ACETONITRILLE items but lesser in HEXANE quantity[30]    However, BPI countered that the acceptance of deliveries violated the BPI Procurement Process Flow in the following respects:    11. x x x Guerrero's report was merely based on the delivery receipts which he did not sign since the Inspection Committee was not informed when said deliveries were made in violation of the procurement process flow of the BPI. Thus, the Inspection and Acceptance Report forms relating to the alleged deliveries were not signed by the designated and authorized officers and personnel of [BPI].[31]    x x x x   20. x x x [T]he delivery receipts in the possession of [BPI] were signed by the personnel in the Laboratory Services Division. Under the BPI Procurement Process Flow, it is the Property Officer who inspects and accepts the deliveries and prepares the corresponding Inspection and Acceptance Report.   20.1 Without said Inspection and Acceptance Report, the corresponding disbursement voucher will not be processed for payment.\"[32]    BPI insisted that Theo-Pam has been BPI's supplier for 20 years. Thus, it \"cannot feign ignorance of [these] rules.\"[33]  Ruling of the COA Proper  In its assailed Decision No. 2016-135, the COA Proper denied Theo-Pam's Money Claim, viz.:   WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition for money claim of Theo-Pam Trading Corporation for payment of various laboratory chemicals in the total amount of P2,361,060.00 plus 12% interest per annum, and attorney's fees and litigation expenses amounting to P590,257.75 is hereby DENIED.[34]   The COA Proper anchored its ruling on Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (Government Audit Code), which requires that \"[c]laims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.\" It pointed out that Theo-Pam's claim is not supported by evidence that sufficiently shows \"actual delivery and substantial compliance with the specifications stated [on] the POs.\"[35] The BPI Process Flow and relevant government accounting procedures[36] require the property officer (i.e., BPI inspector and chief of BPI's Property and Supply Section) to personally inspect the delivery, determine if the quantity and specifications of the goods match those indicated in the PO, and prepare the necessary report (i.e., Inspection and Acceptance Report) to summarize his observations.  Based on these considerations, the COA ruled that the lack of proper documentation raised \"doubt on whether delivery of the laboratory chemicals did take place.\"[37] Further, Theo-Pam, “[b]eing a party to a government transaction, it is duty-bound to know the government requirements.\"[38]  In his dissent,[39] Commissioner Jose A. Fabia pointed out that contrary to the majority opinion, there is substantial evidence showing actual delivery to NPAL, the end user, viz.: (1) the Team Report dated July 9, 2010; (2) certifications issued by NPAL personnel; and (3) delivery receipts, the information on which match those on the respective POs. Further, he stressed on the doctrine of quantum meruit, which allows a private contractor in a government project \"to be reimbursed for the reasonable value of\n",

Centro was complainant Prudencio B. Portuguese, Jr.'s (Portuguese) counsel in Civil Case No. 7177[2] pending before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 32 of Surigao City. Atty. Centro drafted and filed the Answer[3] to the Complaint.[4] Portuguese alleged that at the termination of the proceedings, the parties were required to file their memoranda. After several follow-ups, respondent informed Portuguese that the memorandum was already filed in court.[5] However, on January 25, 2018, to his and his family's shock, Portuguese was served a copy of a Notice[6] by a sheriff, giving them three days to comply with the Writ of Execution[7] in connection with the civil case.[8] Apparently, this was the first time that Portuguese learned of the rendition of a judgment in the said case.[9]  Portuguese claimed that Atty. Centro received a copy of the RTC's July 10, 2017 Decision[10] on August 10, 2017 but the latter never advised him about it. Moreover, Atty. Centro did not file any pleading to appeal or question the RTC's Decision. Worse, Portuguese discovered that Atty. Centro did not actually file a Memorandum contrary to the latter's representation. Portuguese asserted that Atty. Centro also failed to do the following: file any pleading to contest the Motion for Execution; notify him of the scheduled hearing on the Motion for Execution; and inform him about the trial court's resolution granting the Motion for Execution.[11] Lastly, Portuguese averred that respondent is facing other administrative charges, specifically A.C. No. 11421 entitled \"Emilie A. Lao v. Atty. Jerry R. Centro\"[12] and another one supposedly filed by Atty. Centro's spouse.[13]   Report and Recommendation of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP):    In a Report and Recommendation[14] dated April 29, 2019, the Investigating Commissioner[15] recommended the suspension of Atty. Centro from the practice of law for three (3) years.[16] The Investigating Commissioner found that Atty. Centro's inaction deprived the complainant of a relief from the adverse decision in the civil case. As counsel for Portuguese, he neglected to perform his duty to exert efforts to avail of every remedy and defense authorized by the law in order to protect his client's cause. Also, respondent's failure to file a memorandum was a breach of Rule 12.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) which requires lawyers to seasonably file pleadings and to offer an explanation for failure to do so.[17]  Moreover, Atty. Centro violated Rule 18.04 of the CPR which mandates lawyers to keep the client informed of the status of a case. Even after he learned of the RTC's July 10, 2017 Decision on August 10, 2017, Atty. Centro did not inform Portuguese about the adverse judgment to enable his client to decide if an appellate review will be sought. Respondent also failed to notify Portuguese about the Motion for Execution and did not do anything to oppose the motion, assuming there was a ground to do so. Atty. Centro's failure to apprise Portuguese of the developments in the case caught Portuguese off-guard and unprepared.[18] The Investigating Commissioner also noted that Atty. Centro failed to file his Answer to the instant Complaint despite notice,[19] which showed his nonchalance and propensity to ignore lawful orders, in violation of Canon 11 of the CPR which requires lawyers to observe and maintain respect due to the courts and to judicial officers.[20]  In a Resolution[21] dated June 17, 2019, the Board of Governors of the IBP resolved to adopt the findings of the Investigating Commissioner and the recommendation to suspend Atty. Centro from the practice of law for three (3) years.  Our Ruling  We adopt the findings and recommendation of the IBP to suspend respondent from the practice of law for a period of three (3) years.  The Lawyer's Oath[22] mandates every lawyer to conduct himself/herself according to the best of his/her knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to his/her clients. Atty. Centro unfortunately departed from his sworn oath by committing the following acts: 1) failing to file a Memorandum and even misrepresenting about filing it; 2) failing to inform Portuguese of the RTC's Decision; 3) failing to protect Portuguese's interest against the adverse RTC's Decision; 4) failing to inform Portuguese of the Motion for Execution, the scheduled hearing, and the resolution granting the said motion; and 5) failing to file an Answer to the instant Complaint. Worse, when Portuguese confronted him about the deliberate lapses concerning the civil case, the latter merely replied that there was nothing more he could do and that he was giving up the case for good.[23] Considering the foregoing, Atty. Centro is undoubtedly guilty of violating the following provisions of the CPR, to wit:   CANON 11 - A LAWYER SHALL OBSERVE AND MAINTAIN THE RESPECT DUE TO THE COURTS AND TO JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND SHOULD INSIST ON SIMILAR CONDUCT BY OTHERS.   Rule 12.03 - A lawyer shall not, after obtaining extensions of time to file pleadings, memoranda or briefs, let the period lapse without submitting the same or offering an explanation for his failure to do so.   CANON 17 - A LAWYER OWES FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT AND HE SHALL BE MINDFUL OF THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM.   CANON 18 - A LAWYER SHALL SERVE HIS CLIENT WITH COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE.   Rule 18.03 -A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable.   Rule 18.04 -A lawyer shall keep the client informed of the status of his case and shall respond within a reasonable time to the client's request for information.    Atty. Centro's unjustifiable negligence and abandonment of his client's cause violated the Lawyer's Oath as well as the CPR. He casually set aside a legal matter that was entrusted to him and which deserved his full attention and diligence. He was grossly negligent of his duty as counsel and was manifestly disinterested in his client's cause. He must be reminded that as a lawyer, he \"is duty-bound to serve his client with competence, and to attend to his client's cause with diligence, care and devotion. This is because a lawyer owes fidelity to his client's cause and must always be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed on him.\"[24]  In administrative proceedings against a lawyer, the Court, in the exercise of its disciplinary powers, \"calls upon a member of the Bar to account for his actuations as an officer of the Court with the end in view of preserving the purity of the legal profession and the proper and honest administration of justice by purging the profession of members who by their misconduct have proved themselves no longer worthy to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the office of an attorney.\"[25] In this case, We note that Atty. Centro disregarded the directive for him to file his Answer to the Complaint against him. This only goes to show Atty. Centro's indifference to lawful orders and established processes. \"His unexplained disregard of the orders issued to him by the IBP to comment x x x revealed his irresponsibility as well as his disrespect for the IBP and its proceedings. He thereby exposed a character flaw that should not tarnish the nobility of the Legal Profession.\"[26]  Atty. Centro must be reminded that \"being a lawyer is a privilege burdened with conditions.[27] As a member of the bar, [he] must maintain the integrity and dignity of the legal profession by refraining from committing acts which might diminish in any degree the confidence of the public in the fidelity, honesty and integrity of the profession.\"[28] He should have informed Portuguese at the earliest opportunity that he could no longer properly represent him and perform his functions as counsel. This way, Portuguese would have the option to secure the services of another lawyer so that his interests would be protected. Unfortunately, Atty. Centro did not even bother to apprise Portuguese about the developments in the civil case or inform him of his incapacity to continue as counsel. In fine, respondent committed transgressions not only against his client but the IBP and the Court as well. It is settled that \"[a] member of the Bar may be penalized, even disbarred or suspended from his office as an attorney, for violation of the Lawyer's Oath and/or breach of the ethics of the legal profession as embodied in the [CPR]. For the practice of law is 'a profession, a form of public trust, the performance of which is entrusted to those who are qualified and who possess good moral character.' The appropriate penalty for an errant lawyer depends on the exercise of sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts.\"[29] In the case at bench, Atty. Centro, just like other lawyers who have been penalized before him, \"demonstrated not just a negligent disregard of his duties as a lawyer but a wanton betrayal of the trust of his client, the Court, and the public, in general.\"[30] As commensurate penalty for the damage he brought upon Portuguese, a three-year suspension from the practice of law upon him is fitting.[31]  WHEREFORE, for violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility, Atty. Jerry R. Centro is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for three (3) years and WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely. Respondent is DIRECTED to file a Manifestation to this Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.  Let copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of Atty. Jerry R. Centro as an attorney-at-law; to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines; and to the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their guidance and information.

      "This is an appeal from the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals dated July 27, 2018, in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09416, affirming with modification the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Gapan City, Branch 34, Nueva Ecija, which convicted accused-appellant Reymar Masilang y Laciste of the crime of murder and imposed on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua.  Accused-appellant Masilang was charged with the murder of Rose Clarita A. Yuzon (Rose Yuzon) on July 26, 2015 in an Information[2] which reads:   That on the 26th day of July 2015, at Brgy. Mangino, in the City of Gapan, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being armed with a bolo, with intent to kill, qualified by evident premeditation as the attack was contrived and taking advantage of the minority of the victim and treachery, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence upon the person of ROSE CLARITA YUZON Y ADALLA, a minor 17 years old, as follows: while the victim was inside the cemetery with the accused and while being blind-folded, and her back was turned against the accused, unarmed and completely unaware that she will be the subject of an attack by the accused, thereby, placing said victim in no position to defend herself from the sudden and unexpected attack, suddenly was attacked by the accused with the use of the said bolo by hacking the victim several times, hitting the latter on different parts of her body and banging her head in the steel gate, thereby inflicting upon her person mortal wounds which directly caused her death, to the damage and prejudice of the family of said victim.   CONTRARY TO LAW.    When arraigned on September 11, 2015, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.[3]  During pre-trial, the prosecution and the defense stipulated on these facts: (1) accused Reymar Masilang's identity; (2) accused Masilang and the victim, Rose Yuzon, were sweethearts prior to July 26, 2015; (3) out of the three (3) witnesses, namely, Edgardo Gamboa, Marcelo Perez, and Juanestor Yuzon, accused Masilang only knew Juanestor; and (4) the authenticity and issuance of the death certificate of Rose Yuzon and her two pictures as well as the picture of the place where she was found dead.[4] During trial, the prosecution presented Edgardo Gamboa and Senior Police Officer 1 Edmer Portillo, the assigned police investigator, as witnesses. The defense presented Reymar Masilang as witness, while the testimony of his aunt, Rosalie Masilang, was dispensed with after the prosecution and the defense stipulated that she requested accused-appellant's presence in the fencing of her property at P. Cruz Subdivision, Gapan City, Nueva Ecija, but accused-appellant did not come.  The evidence of the prosecution established that in the morning of July 26, 2015, Edgardo was inside the Gapan City Public Cemetery in Barangay Mangino, Gapan City. He was with two companions, Ivan Perez and John Mark Torres. They went to the cemetery to watch (\"namboboso\") couples engaging in sexual intercourse by peeping through tombs and mausoleums. Gamboa is a laborer who lives in one of the houses at the back of the cemetery.[5]  That morning, as soon as Gamboa entered the cemetery, he noticed the arrival, on board a tricyle, of a young lady who turned out to be the victim, Rose Yuzon. The girl was holding a cell phone when she entered the place. A few moments later, Gamboa saw the girl rushing out of the cemetery only to re-enter the place through the other gate. She proceeded to the old portion of the cemetery. Fifteen minutes later, Gamboa entered the old portion of the cemetery where he saw the girl. This time, he saw her with a male companion who Gamboa later identified as the accused-appellant Reymar Masilang. Watching from a safe distance, Gamboa, who was still with John Mark Torres, saw accused-appellant and the girl talking, then accused-appellant handed the girl a hamburger. A child approached the accused-appellant and the girl, presumably begging for food. After the child walked away, accused-appellant and the girl proceeded to a steel and concrete structure housing a tomb, which Gamboa called a \"tent.\" The couple went inside and accused-appellant closed its iron door slightly. Gamboa and Torres moved closer to the back portion of the tented tomb. Gamboa heard accused-appellant telling the girl that he had a surprise for her. Torres made a hand signal which meant that accused-appellant and the girl were about to engage in sex. Gamboa peeped through a hole in the \"tent.\" He saw accused-appellant hacking the girl with a small bolo. The girl's hands were on both sides of her face, while her eyes were covered with a red handkerchief. He heard the girl cry for help. Shocked at what he just saw, Gamboa had to lean against a concrete wall. When he looked again, he saw accused-appellant holding the girl's head and banging it against the front portion of the tomb. Gamboa and his companion ran away.[6]  The victim, Rose Yuzon, died from \"severe traumatic brain injury secondary to multiple hacking wound.\"[7]  Accused-appellant gave a different version and put up the defense of denial and alibi. Accused-appellant testified that on July 26, 2015, at 7:30 a.m., he was on his way to the house of his aunt, Rosalie Masilang, to help build the fence of her house in P. Cruz Subdivision, Mangino, Gapan City. He brought with him a bolo and a handbag. Before proceeding to his aunt's house, he passed by the Gapan City Cemetery to visit his grandfather's tomb and to meet Rose Yuzon, his girlfriend. He gave Rose a hamburger and told her of his plan to visit his grandfather's tomb, but she refused to let him leave because she was afraid of a suspicious man who seemed to be following her when she entered the cemetery. After a while, appellant told Rose that he had a surprise for her and blindfolded her just as what they used to do. When the revealing of the surprise took longer than expected, Rose exclaimed \"lintik,\" which irritated appellant. He walked away to look for his grandfather's tomb. Less than five minutes later, he heard Rose shouting and crying for help. He could not immediately respond to her as the place was grassy and high-rise tombs blocked his way; thus, he proceeded to the second gate of the cemetery to ask for help from the guards. Before he could reach the second gate, a man approached him and asked if he knew the girl who was killed while pointing to the place where Rose was. Appellant immediately went to see Rose, but another man, later identified as Marcelo Perez, told him not to move or run away from where he was standing. Marcelo Perez, while holding a piece of wood, brought appellant to the location of Rose who was slumped on the floor. Thereafter, the policemen arrested appellant and seized his handbag with his bolo inside and brought him to the police station.[8]  In a Decision[9] dated April 28, 2017, the RTC found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified by treachery, as the victim could not have defended herself from the sudden and unexpected attack on her person by accused-appellant.  The trial court did not believe accused-appellant's defense of denial and alibi in light of the positive testimony of prosecution eyewitness Edgardo Gamboa that accused-appellant was the person who hacked the victim with a bolo and banged her head against the front portion of a tomb.  The trial court did not award civil damages to the heirs of the victim on the ground that the parents of the victim submitted two separate affidavits[10] of desistance wherein they waived their criminal and civil claims against accused-appellant. The trial court stated that prior to the submission of the affidavits of desistance, the victim's parents admitted to the court that they had agreed to settle the case with the accused-appellant for the amount of P100,000.00.[11] However, not one of the victim's parents testified for the prosecution or for the defense.  The dispositive portion of the Decision of the RTC reads:   WHEREFORE, premises considered, the court finds accused Reymar Masilang y Laciste GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and hereby imposes on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua. No costs.   Upon promulgation of this judgment, the warden of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) Gapan City Jail is hereby ORDERED to commit the accused to the National Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City for the service of his sentence.   SO ORDERED.[12] (Italics in the original)    Accused-appellant appealed the decision of the RTC to the Court of Appeals, contending that the trial court erred: (1) in convicting the accused-appellant of murder despite his doubtful identification as culprit; (2) in finding the accused-appellant guilty of murder despite the prosecution's failure to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery; and (3) in convicting the accused-appellant of murder despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.[13]  In its Decision dated July 27, 2018, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the RTC with modification as it awarded civil, moral and exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim. The appellate court stated that although the victim's parents executed the Sinumpaang Salaysay ng Pag-uurong ng Habla at Gawad ng Kapangyarihan and Sinumpaang Salaysay ng Pagbawi sa mga Salaysay at Pag-uurong ng Habla, the records do not show that they appeared in court to confirm the execution of their affidavits of desistance or their alleged receipt of P100,000.00 from accused-appellant. In view of the failure to present the affiants as witnesses, the Court of Appeals held that no probative value can be given to the said affidavits. It cited People v. Castillo,[14] wherein the error of the trial court in absolving accused-appellant of any civil liability on the basis of the affidavits of desistance executed by the victim's relatives was rectified.  The fallo of the Decision of the Court of Appeals reads:   WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby DENIED. The April 28, 2017 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 34, Gapan City, Nueva Ecija in Criminal Case No. 18767-15 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that accused-appellant Reymar Masilang y Laciste is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of Rose Clarita Yuzon y Adalla civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00 each, which shall be subject to 6% interest per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.   SO ORDERED.[15]   The case was elevated to this Court on appeal. In a Resolution[16] dated June 3, 2019, the Court notified the parties that they may file their respective Supplemental Briefs, if they so desire, within 30 days from notice. Both parties filed their respective Manifestation,[17] informing the Court that they were no longer filing a Supplemental Brief as they had already discussed exhaustively all relevant issues in their respective Appellant's Brief/Appellee's Brief.  The main issue is whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's decision that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder.  The crime of murder, under Article 248[18] of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), is committed by any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246[19] (parricide) of the RPC, shall kill another with any of the attendant circumstances enumerated in Article 248, which include treachery. The crime of murder is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death.  In his Appellant's Brief, accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred: (1) in convicting him of murder despite his doubtful identification as culprit; (2) in finding him guilty of murder despite the prosecution's failure to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery; and (3) in convicting him of murder despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.[20]  Accused-appellant asserts that his identification as the culprit is doubtful as it was established only through the lone testimony of prosecution witness Edgardo Gamboa, with no other corroborating evidence. In addition, the name and identity of appellant as culprit was not reflected in Gamboa's affidavit and Gamboa testified that he did not remember the faces of the people he \"watched\" in the cemetery.  The assertion is untenable. An accused is convicted, not on the basis of the number of witnesses against him, but on the credibility of the testimony of even one witness who is able to convince the court of the guilt of the accused beyond a shadow of a doubt; in other words, not quantitatively but qualitatively.[21] Although prosecution eyewitness Edgardo Gamboa did not know accused-appellant before the incident, Gamboa was able to identify the accused-appellant because of the length of time he watched the accused-appellant and the victim in broad daylight and his proximity to them. Gamboa testified, thus:    COURT:          Q: You said that you and Mr. Masilang, the accused in this case did not know each other before the incident. Is that correct?         A: Yes, your Honor.          Q: So, that was the first time you saw him?          A:  Yes, your Honor.          Q: So, how can you be sure that he was the one who killed the victim in this case if that is the only time you saw him?         A:  Because before the killing, they talked for some time so I was able to recognize his face, your Honor.          Q:  How long did they talk before the girl was killed?          A: About half an hour, your Honor.          Q:  So, what happened within this period of half an hour or thirty minutes? What was the first thing you saw the accused and the victim were doing?         A: They were talking, your Honor.          Q: Did you hear what they were talking about?         A:  No, your Honor, because at first, we were a little bit far.         Q: So, after talking, what else did you see?         A:  After talking, the accused gave the girl the burger and that time we were already close to them, your Honor.          Q: So, after being close to them, what did you witness?         A: The accused invited the girl inside the musoleo, your Honor.         Q: And did you see them inside the musoleo?         A: Yes, your Honor.         COURT:       Q: Why did you see these people inside when you were outside?          A: We placed ourselves in a position that we would have a clear view of them, your Honor.          Q: So what did you witness inside the musoleo?          A:  They again talked and while they were doing that, I walked to the back of the musoleo, your Honor.         Q: You were saying that you were at the back of the musoleo. So how close was that to the accused and the victim?         A: About four meters away, your Honor.         Q: And what did you see from your position?          A: I heard the man telling the girl that he has a surprise, your Honor.        COURT:          Q: After saying that, what did he do?        WITNESS:          A:  According to my companions, they would start having sex, your Honor. And when I look at them, I saw the man hacking the victim.[22]     As noted by the Court of Appeals, the killing occurred in broad daylight and Edgardo Gamboa was only four (4) meters away from accused-appellant and the victim when he was peeping through a small hole at the back of the mausoleum.[23] Before the incident, Gamboa also watched accused-appellant and the victim conversing for 30 minutes. Thus, Gamboa was able to recognize the face of accused-appellant.  Accused-appellant contends that Gamboa testified that he could not remember the faces of all the people he \"watched\" in the cemetery. However, in this particular case, it is evident from Gamboa's testimony that he remembered the face of accused-appellant and the victim because his attention was focused on them as sweethearts on a date, and he and his companion were following them to see what would happen next, which led Gamboa to witnessing the killing of Rose Yuzon by the accused-appellant. As regards Gamboa's failure to state accused-appellant's name when he executed his affidavit, the Court of Appeals aptly stated:   Similarly, Edgardo's failure to state Reymar's name when he executed his Malaya at Kusang Loob na Salaysay does not diminish his credibility as a witness. It only shows that at the time of the execution of the sworn statement, Reymar's name was not yet known to Edgardo. However, during Edgardo's direct testimony, he positively and categorically identified Reymar as the person who killed Rose Clarita. It bears stress\n",

      "Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[1] of the Sandiganbayan, First Division, in Criminal Case Nos. SB-11-CRM-0036-37 and SB-11-CRM-0038-39, entitled \"People of the Philippines v. Gov. Raul R. Lee, Raul G. Hernandez, and Ofelia D. Velasco.\"  The antecedent facts are summarized as follows:  In 2004, through the initiative of then Governor Raul R. Lee, the Province of Sorsogon was allocated with the amount of P5,000,000.00 from the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) appropriations to finance the acquisition of agricultural supplies and inputs for the Province of Sorsogon under the project entitled \"Financial Assistance to Small and Marginal Farmers of the Province of Sorsogon for Agricultural Reinforcement Project. \" Governor Lee was the lead implementer of the said project.  In two occasions, Governor Lee took the lead in purchasing 2,000 liters of liquid fertilizer in the total amount of P3,000,000.00 at P1,500.00 per liter, and 133 liters of liquid fertilizer in the amount of P199,500.00 also at P1,500.00 per liter, for distribution to small and marginal farmers in the Province of Sorsogon.  However, in the Annual Audit Report on the Province of Sorsogon for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 prepared by the Commission on Audit, and which was later on presented as one of the documentary exhibits of the prosecution, it was observed that certain transactions did not comply with the laws, rules and regulations.  This observation pertains to: (1) the establishment of three distance learning centers in the Provincial Capitol of Sorsogon, (2) the procurement and distribution of 2,133 liters of liquid fertilizers by the Province, and (3) poor collection performance of the provincial share of RPT/SET from the municipalities. The audit observation on the procurement and distribution of the 2,133 liters of fertilizers was based on the following documents: Disbursement Vouchers, checks, Journal Entry Vouchers, Purchase Request, Purchase Orders, invoices, inspection and acceptance reports, certifications from Governor Lee, request and issue slips, Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between Gov. Lee and Dr. Hector Sales of the Department of Agriculture (DA) Regional Field Unit V. All these documents were submitted by the Province of Sorsogon to Auditor Binamira.  The Provincial Government received the P5,000,000.00 in two tranches. The first tranche was received on April 16, 2004 in the amount of P3,250,000.00 per Disbursement Voucher (DV) and OR No. 6175876. The second tranche was received by the Province on December 28, 2004 in the amount of P1,750,000.00 per OR No. 5661194.  The subject 2,133 liters of fertilizers were procured in two batches. The first batch of 2,000 liters was purchased on April 16, 2004, as shown by Purchase Request No. 300-04-04-405-A, and the second batch of 133 liters was bought on April 22, 2004, per Purchase Request No. 300-04-04-16.  The said fertilizers were procured through direct contracting. There was no document that would show that a public bidding was conducted. The documents submitted to the witness were only the Purchase Requests, Abstract of Proposal on Personal Canvass, Purchase Orders, Invoices, Inspection and Acceptance Reports, Letter of Appointment of Bio Nature Technology PTE Ltd. To Feshan Phils., Certifications signed by Governor Lee acknowledging receipt of the 2,000 and 133 liters of fertilizers, and the canvasses showing that the source of the fertilizer was only Feshan Phils. Inc. The procurement was requested and approved by Governor Lee.  The COA Auditor observed that the Purchase Requests specified the brand name Bio Nature Organic Fertilizer, in violation of the law mandating that procurement of goods shall be based on relevant characteristics, and reference to brand names shall not be allowed.  The COA Auditor explained that in procurement procedure, the purchase request must be submitted to the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of the procuring entity which must make a determination of the appropriate mode of procurement. The decision must be embodied in a BAC resolution. If the mode of procurement chosen is not public bidding, the reason must be stated in the BAC resolution. The BAC resolution should have been referred to the Governor as the head of the procuring entity, and the Governor should approve the issuance of a notice of award and notice to proceed, to be followed by the delivery and inspection of the fertilizer and then payment thereof.  The COA Auditor noted, however, that in this case, there was no BAC resolution, notice of award and notice to proceed. The BAC issued Abstracts of Proposal on Personal Canvass instead of a resolution, and awarded the procurement of 2,000 liters and 133 liters of fertilizer to Feshan Phils. Inc. at P1,500.00 per liter through direct contracting. Invoices No. 5751 and No. 5731 were issued on the very day the deliveries were made. The inspection and acceptance reports bore the same date as that of the invoices.  To justify the resort to direct contracting, the Provincial Government submitted a Letter of Appointment dated January 5, 2004 from Derek G. Glass, Managing Director of Bio Nature Technology Pte. Ltd. (BNTPT), addressed to Feshan Phils. Inc. However, records show that there were other suppliers in the market selling the same product at a much lower price. Moreover, there were other suitable substitutes available in the market for the liquid fertilizers purchased from Feshan Phils. Inc. This was shown by the price canvass dated November 24, 2004 from JL Trading in San Vicente, Camarines Sur, price canvass dated November 24, 2004 from Unibest Enterprises in Pili, Camarines Sur, and Sales Invoice dated February 9, 2004 from JL Trading.  It was also noted that the office addresses of Feshan Phils. Inc. are located in Metro Manila while the other possible suppliers are located in Camarines Sur, which is about 150 kilometers away from Sorsogon.  The payment of the purchase of 2,000 liters from Feshan Phils. Inc. was evidenced by DV No. 8220, LBP Check No. 311701, and OR No. 1541; while the payment for the purchase of 133 liters was evidenced by DV No. 200, LBP Check No. 311702, and OR NO. 1543.  It was likewise discovered that Feshan Phils. Inc. was not granted a license in 2004 by the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA). Likewise, the purchase price paid by the Province of Sorsogon for the fertilizers was way higher than the prices listed in the Average Prices of Fertilizers and Pesticides prepared by FPA.  Following a finding of probable cause by the Office of the Ombudsman with respect to the purchase of 2,133 liters of fertilizer, four Informations were filed against Governor Lee, Hernandez, and Velasco before the Sandiganbayan - two Informations for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, docketed as SB-11-CRM-0036 and 0037, and two Informations for violation of Section 3(g), docketed as SB-11-CRM-003 8 and 0039. Subsequently, the Informations in SB-11-CRM-0036 and 0037 were amended and, after such amendments, the accusatory portions of all the Informations read as follows:  SB-11-CRM-0036   That on 01 June 2004, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Province of Sorsogon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, Raul R.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[2]    On March 6, 2012, Governor Lee and Velasco filed a motion to quash (first motion to quash) dated September 23, 2013, arguing that their right to speedy disposition of cases were violated, and that there is no probable cause to charge them with violations of R.A. No. 3019.  This was denied by the Sandiganbayan in a Resolution dated June 18, 2012, citing Dela Peña v. Sandiganbayan[3] where it was ruled that the failure of the petitioners to earlier invoke the right to speedy disposition of cases during the preliminary investigation constitutes laches or his waiver of the said right.  On July 18, 2012, with the exception of the other accused, Governor Lee moved for the reconsideration of the June 18, 2012 Resolution.  In the meantime, Velasco and Hernandez were arraigned on September 6, 2012.  In its Resolution dated October 8, 2012, the Sandiganbayan denied Lee's motion for reconsideration. This prompted Lee to file a Petition for Certiorari dated December 20, 2012 before us to assail the June 18, 2012 and October 8, 2012 Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan, ascribing to the latter grave abuse of discretion in denying the first motion to quash wherein he involved a violation of his right to speedy disposition of cases. The petition was docketed as G.R. Nos. 204784-87.  Subsequently, in a Resolution dated January 23, 2013, this Court dismissed Lee's December 20, 2012 Petition for Certiorari as it failed to show any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan when it denied Lee's first motion to quash. Lee moved for reconsideration but it was denied with finality in a Resolution dated June 19, 2013.  Lee was eventually arraigned on February 26, 2013.  Upon arraignment, the accused separately pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. During the pre-trial, the parties agreed that the lone issue to be resolved is whether or not the accused are liable for violation of Section 3(e) and Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 in the purchase of 133 liters and 2,000 liters of Bio Nature Liquid Fertilizer from Feshan Phils. Inc. through direct contracting.  On September 26, 2013, however, accused Lee and Velasco filed another motion to quash (second motion to quash) arguing that the Sandiganbayan was dislodged of jurisdiction to try the instant because of our ruling in Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan, et al.,[4] where it was held that it was not the duty of a respondent in a preliminary investigation to follow up the prosecution of his case; instead it was the duty of the Ombudsman or prosecutor to expedite the same within t\n",

      "The CasePetitioner National Power Corporation (NPC)[1] assails the Court of Appeals' Decision[2] dated June 27, 2008 and Resolution[3] dated January 12, 2011 in CA-G.R. SP No. 101986 upholding the order for NPC to vacate subject property and to pay monthly rentals thereon.AntecedentsOn October 27, 2006, respondents Spouses Rufo and Tomasa Llorin (Spouses Llorin), represented by their attorney-in-fact, Corazon Candelaria filed before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC)-Naga City a complaint for unlawful detainer[4] against NPC docketed Civil Case No. 12712. It was raffled off to Branch 1.Essentially, Spouses Llorin alleged that they are the registered owners of a 102,606-square meter (sq. m.) parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 29725 (Lot 3162-B-2 of subdivision survey Psd-05-020261) and located in Brgy. San Felipe, Naga City.Sometime in 1978, NPC occupied the property without the consent of their predecessors-in-interest and started the construction and installation of 69 kV Naga-Tinambac power transmission lines, affecting a total of 10,500 sq. m. of the property.Their predecessors-in-interest tolerated NPC's occupation of their property on the latter's assurance that the structures were only temporary, it would vacate the property when the owners already needed it and monthly rentals would be paid.When they and their predecessors-in-interest subsequently demanded the return of the property and payment of monthly rentals, NPC continuously failed and refused to heed their demand. Thus, on August 30, 2006, they served their last formal demand on NPC.In its answer with compulsory counterclaim, NPC claimed that the complaint should be dismissed because it stated no cause of action against it. The subject transmission assets had already been transferred to the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) by virtue of Republic Act No. 9136[5] (RA 9136). The complaint was also barred by prescription and laches.[6]Ruling of the MTCCUnder Decision[7] dated June 19, 2007, the MTCC ruled in favor of Spouses Llorin, viz.:WHEREFORE, premises considered, decision is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff Sps. Rufo Llorin and Tomasa Tijam-Liorin, ordering defendant NAPOCOR1. To vacate the subject properties and turn over it [sic] possession to plaintiff;2. To pay to plaintiff monthly rental of Php5,000.00 per month as rental for the use of land from September, 2006 until the land is finally vacated;3. To pay to plaintiff the amount of Php20,000.00 as attorney's fee plus cost.SO ORDERED.Ruling of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)On appeal, RTC-Naga City, Branch 26, affirmed under Decision[8] dated December 7, 2007.NPC consequently went to the Court of Appeals by way of petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.Ruling of the Court of Appeals By Decision[9] dated June 27, 2008, the Court of Appeals, too, affirmed, thus:WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. Accordingly, the assailed Decision dated December 7, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 26, Naga City, which affirmed the Decision dated June 19, 2007 of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 1, Naga City in Civil Case No. 12712 is hereby AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.The Court of Appeals ruled that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient for unlawful detainer to prosper. The right of Spouses Llorin to recover possession of their property cannot be defeated by laches or prescription. The non-inclusion of TRANSCO in the case was not fatal considering that the parties, during the pre-trial, had already agreed that the ownership of the transmission lines remained with NPC and TRANSCO is its operator.Under Resolution[10] dated January 12, 2011, the Court of Appeals denied NPC's motion for reconsideration.The Present PetitionNPC argues in the main that (1) the MTCC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint, (2) the complaint was already barred by laches and prescription, (3) TRANSCO, an indispensable party, was not impleaded, and (4) the proper remedy of Spouses Llorin was to claim for just compensation.Considering that Spouses Llorin failed to file the required comment, the Court resolved to dispense with it per Resolution dated October 9, 2019.IssueDoes an action for unlawful detainer lie to oust the NPC (TRANSCO) from the property which holds its 69 kV Naga-Tinambac power transmission lines since 1978?RulingWe reverse.There is no dispute that since 1978, subject property has been devoted for a public purpose serving as site for the government's 69 kV Naga-Tinambac power transmission lines. Under RA 9136, TRANSCO has assumed the electrical transmission functions of the NPC, including the latter's power of eminent domain necessary for the discharge of these functions. Sec. 8 of RA 9136 provides:SEC. 8. Creation of the National Transmission Company. There is hereby created a National Transmission Corporation, hereinafter referred to as TRANSCO, which shall assume the electrical transmission function of the National Power Corporation (NPC), and have the power and functions hereinafter granted. The TRANSCO shall assume the authority and responsibility of NPC for the planning, construction and centralized operation and maintenance of its high voltage transmission facilities, including grid interconnections and ancillary services.Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, the transmission and subtransmission facilities of NPC and all other assets related to transmission operations, including the nationwide franchise of NPC for the operation of the transmission system and the grid, shall be transferred to the TRANSCO. The TRANSCO shall be wholly owned by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM Corp.).The subtransmission functions and assets shall be segregated from the transmission functions, assets and liabilities for transparency and disposal: Provided, That the subtransmission assets shall be operated and maintained by TRANSCO until their disposal to qualified distribution utilities which are in a position to take over the responsibility for operating, maintaining, upgrading, and expanding said assets. All transmission and subtransmission related liabilities of NPC shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp.TRANSCO shall negotiate with and thereafter transfer such functions, assets, and associated liabilities to the qualified distribution utility or utilities connected to such subtransmission facilities not later than two (2) years from the effectivity of this Act or the start of open access, whichever comes earlier: x x x.As ordained in the leading case of National Transmission Corp. v. Bermuda Development Corp.,[11] for reasons of public policy and public necessity, as well as equitable estoppel, the remedy of unlawful detainer is unavailing to compel a public utility to vacate subject property. \"The proper recourse is for the ejectment court: (1) to dismiss the case without prejudice to the landowner filing the proper action for recovery of just compensation and consequential damages; or (2) to dismiss the case and direct the public utility corporation to institute the proper expropriation or condemnation proceedings and to pay the just compensation and consequential damages assessed therein; or (3) to continue with the case as if it were an expropriation case and determine the just compensation and consequential damages pursuant to Rule 67 (Expropriation) of the Rules of Court, if the ejectment court has jurisdiction over the value of the subject land.\" Thus:Thus, it is well-settled that a case filed by a landowner for recovery of possession or ejectment against a public utility corporation, endowed with the power of eminent domain, which has occupied the land belonging to the former in the interest of public service without prior acquisition of title thereto by negotiated purchase or expropriation proceedings, will not prosper. Any action to compel the public utility corporation to vacate such property is unavailing since the landowner is denied the remedies of ejectment and injunction for reasons of public policy and public necessity as well as equitable estoppel. The proper recourse is for the ejectment court: (1) to dismiss the case without prejudice to the landowner filing the proper action for recovery of just compensation and consequential damages; or (2) to dismiss the case and direct the public utility corporation to institute the proper expropriation or condemnation proceedings and to pay the just compensation and consequential damages assessed therein; or (3) to continue with the case as if it were an expropriation case and determine the just compensation and consequential damages pursuant to Rule 67 (Expropriation) of the Rules of Court, if the ejectment court has jurisdiction over the value of the subject land. (Emphasis supplied)Here, the MTCC therefore should have dismissed the case without prejudice to the landowner's filing of the proper action for just compensation and consequential damages; or directed the NPC (TRANSCO) to initiate the proper expropriation proceedings and to pay just compensation and consequential damages. Notably, the considerable length of time that elapsed before Spouses Llorin or their predecessors-in-interest questioned the government's so called unconsented entry into the property and installation of the 69 kV Naga-Tinambac power transmission lines, sans expropriation proceedings, constitutes a waiver of their right to gain back its possession.[12] To repeat, the remedy left for them is to claim for just compensation.ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 27, 2008 and Resolution dated January 12, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 101986 as well as the Decision dated June 19, 2007 of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities-Naga City, Branch 1 in Civil Case No. 12712 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The complaint for unlawful detainer filed before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities-­Naga City, Branch 1 in Civil Case No. 12712 is DISMISSED, without prejudice to the filing of the action for just compensation and consequential damages.SO ORDERED.Perlas-Bernabe, Senior Associate Justice, (Chairperson), Gesmundo, Lopez, and Rosario,* JJ., concur.* Designated as additional member per S.O.

      "Before Us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the September 29, 2011 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 86968. The CA affirmed the January 26, 2006 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court, Santa Cruz, Laguna, Branch 91 (RTC) which dismissed the complaint filed by petitioner Republic of the Philippines (the Republic) for failure to state a cause of action.AntecedentsThe CA summarized the facts as follows:On 30 May 1986, Anna R. Lontok (A. Lontok) was granted Free Patent No. (IV-2) 27332 by the Department of [Environment and] Natural Resources thru the Bureau of Lands, NR District No. IV-2, Los Baños, Laguna over a parcel of land located at Banca-Banca, Victoria, Laguna more particularly described as Lot No. 97-A CSD-04-005006 (Cad/Pls No. 420- D) with a total area of 2,180 sq. meters (subject property, for brevity). On even date, defendant-appellee A. Lontok was issued Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-8554 by the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Laguna.On 11 November 1991, A. Lontok sold 1,623 sq. meter portion of the subject property to defendant-appellee The Rising Sun Motors Corporation (defendant-appellee Rising Sun), represented by its president Napoleon A. Dator, Jr. As a consequence, OCT No. P-8554 was cancelled insofar as the 1,623 sq. meter portion was concerned and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-129346 was issued by the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Laguna to defendant-appellee Rising Sun on 25 November 1991. Defendant-appellee Rising Sun, thereafter, occupied the property covered by TCT No. T-129346.It appears on record that OCT No. P-8554 had been totally cancelled by TCT No. T-129346 and TCTs Nos. 129354-55, but no other information exists as to the specificity of the two latter titles.On 19 January 1994, the heirs of Sps. Juanito Armando and Rizalina Bartolome (protestants) filed a formal protest before the Department of Envirorunent and Natural Resources (DENR) - Manila against the issuance of the free patent in A. Lontok's name. Protestants' allegations was summarized by the DENR-Manila as follows:[T]hat protestants are the children of the late spouses Dr. Juanito Armando Bartolome and Rizalina Sison; that upon the death of their late father, he left a parcel of land situated in Banca-Banca, Victoria, Laguna with an area of .310 hectare, of which .2980 hectare is agricultural and 200 square meters is residential; that the agricultural portion of the land is devoted to coconuts, lanzones, star apple and avocado; that said parcel of land is covered by a tax declaration and that realty taxes thereon had been paid up to the year 1993, as shown by the Certification issued by the Municipal Treasurer of Victoria, Laguna dated January 10, 1994; that protestants' father acquired the land in tum from his late father Juan Bartolome by way of his last will dated October 19, 1936 probated by the court in SP No. 3539; that the protestants' ownership of property was attested by Monina Corcuera, daughter of Eduardo Gutierrez, the former overseer of the property in an Affidavit dated October 19, 1993 and by Estelita Sangalang, an [adjoining) landowner in an Affidavit dated January 4, 1994; that the cadastral survey of Victoria, Laguna Cad-427-D was surveyed in the name of Juanito Armando as Lot No. 97, Cad-427-D with an area of 2,980 square meters; that on February 28, 1986, the District Land Officer of Land District IV-2, upon request of respondents, issued Survey Authority No. 248-86 to subdivide Lot 97, Cad. 427 D-situated in Banca-Banca, Victoria, Laguna; that pursuant to the survey authority, the respondents caused the subdivision of Lot 97, Cad. 427-D into Lots 97-A and 97-B under plan Csd-04-005006 approved by the Lands Regional Director on March 18, 1986; that subsequent thereto, respondent Anna Ramirez Lontok filed with the District Land Office of Los Baños, Laguna, Free Patent Application No. 20722 covering Lot No. 97-A with an area of 2,180 sq. meters; that after final investigation report was duly submitted by Land Inspector Rogelio Diamante, Free Patent No. 27332 was issued on May 30, 1986 which was registered on even date with the Register of Deeds. x x xInvestigation ensued, and on 18 January 1995, a Resolution was issued by the DENR-Manila thru its Regional Executive Director for Region IV-A, Antonio G. Principe, recommending the cancellation of A. Lontok's Free Patent No. (IV-2) 27332 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-8554. The pertinent portion of the Resolution reads:x x x xBased on the investigation/ocular inspection conducted (sic) it was evident that protestants through their predecessors-in­-interest have proven substantially their claim of ownership over the controverted Lot No. 97-A. The fact of their possession of a portion thereof does not preclude them from claiming the whole lot identified as Cad Lot No. 97, since the subsequent sub-division was without the protestants' knowledge.WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is hereby, as it is, ordered that a CANCELLATION proceeding be instituted against Free Patent No. 27332 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-8554 issued in the name of Anna Ramirez Lontok over Lot 97-A and such other title/s emanating from the FP of Lontok by this Office in accordance with the Office of the Solicitor General.SO ORDERED.On 17 July 1998, the Republic thru the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Complaint for Annulment of Patent and Cancellation of Title against the Spouses Virgilio and A. Lontok (Spouses Lontok) and defendant-appellee Rising Sun docketed as SC 3723. It was alleged in the Complaint that a protest was filed by the Heirs of the Spouses Juanita Armando and Rizalina Bartolome against the issuance of A. Lontok's Free Patent No. (N-2) 27332, and which protest was subject of an administrative investigation by the DENR-Manila. It was further alleged in the Complaint that: (1) protestants, together with their predecessors-in-interest have been in continuous and adverse possession of the subject property since time immemorial; (2) A. Lontok committed fraud and misrepresentation in her free patent application when she claimed that she had complied with all the cultivation and residence requirement of the free patent law, when in fact she was not in possession of the subject property; and (3) A. Lontok's misrepresentation constitutes sufficient ground for the cancellation of the patent and the corresponding title issued to her under the mandate of Section 91 of the Public Land Act. The Republic prayed for the following reliefs:x x x x1. Declaring Free Patent No. (IV-2) 27332 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-8554 in the name of defendant Anna Ramirez Lontok, TCT No. T-129346 in the name of defendant Rising Sun Motors Corporation, and all other derivative titles, in [sic] any, null and void ab initio;2. Ordering defendants Anna Ramirez Lontok and Rising Sun Motors Corporation to surrender their respective owners' duplicate certificates of title to the Register of Deeds of Laguna and the latter to cancel the same as well as all other derivative titles, if any; and3. Ordering the reversion of land covered by the aforesaid patent and titles to the mass of the public domain under the administration and disposition of the Director of Lands.x x x xOn 17 December 1998, defendant-appellee Rising Sun filed its Answer with Counterclaim denying the allegations in the Complaint and countered that it was a buyer in good faith and is not aware of any imperfection in A. Lontok's title to the subject property. Rising Sun also alleged, among others, that (1) the Republic has no cause of action against it; (2) the cause of action had prescribed or barred by the statute of limitations since the Free Patent No. (IV-2) 27332 and OCT No. P-8554 was issued to A. Lontok on 30 May 1986; (3) the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action; (4) that the cause of action had been barred by prior judgment/order and thus, constitutes res judicata; and (5) the Republic is guilty of forum shopping.On 18 December 1998, the Spouses Lontok filed their Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim claiming regularity in the issuance of Free Patent No. 27332 on 30 May 1986. In their defense, the Spouses Lontok alleged, among others, that the Republic had not been candid with the court as it failed to mention that it had filed a similar case before the Municipal Trial Court of Victoria[,] Laguna on 26 December 1996.On 1 February 2000, the court a quo issued a Pre-Trial Order defining the issues of the case, as follows:x x x xWhether plaintiff has a cause of action against defendants;Whether the Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter, or nature of the action;Whether free patent (sic) No. (IV-2) 27332 and original certificate of title (sic) No. P-8554 are null and void ab initio;Whether the defendant corporation is a purchaser in good faith;Whether the plaintiff is guilty of Forum Shopping;Whether the cause of action of the plaintiff had prescribed or barred by the statute (sic) of Limitations, since the original certificate of title (free patent) was issued on 30 May 1986;Whether the cause of action had been barred by prior judgment (principle of res judicata) in Civil Cases No. SC 3042, RTC, Branch 27, SC-No. 3397 RTC Branch 91 (sic). x x xDuring the proceedings a quo, a Motion to Withdraw Appearance dated 29 October 2001 was filed by Spouses Lontok's counsel, Atty. Antonio Oliva, citing irreconcilable differences in the handling of the case. He also stated that the consent of the Spouses Lontok was not obtained and that the latter had manifested their financial constraints in paying for his services. Nothing on record shows that Atty. Oliva's Motion to Withdraw Appearance was acted upon by the court a quo. Records disclosed that as of 18 January 2002, there was no appearance in court of the Spouses Lontok.[4] (citations omitted)The RTC RulingIn its Decision dated January 26, 2006, the RTC dismissed the case for the Republic's failure to establish its cause of action, thus:WHEREFORE, premises considered, for failure of the plaintiff to establish its cause of action against the defendants, the instant case is hereby DISMISSED and no damages are awarded as the plaintiff is representing the Government. Defendants spouses Virgilio and Anna Ramirez-Lontok, Rising Sun Motors Corporation, rep. by Napoleon A. Dator, Jr., the registered owners of the respective portions of the land, subject matter of this case are entitled to the lawful ownership, possession and enjoyment thereof. Defendant's counterclaim for other damages is likewise dismissed for lack of sufficient basis.SO ORDERED.[5]The trial court held that based on the findings of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the subject property is private in character, to which an action for reversion shall not avail.The CA RulingOn appeal, the CA affirmed the RTC and noted that the Republic had asserted in its appellant's brief that the subject property is considered private land, to wit:[A]ppellee Spouses Lontok should not have been granted a patent as the subject property had been considered private in nature in favor of the protestants led by Melinda Bartolome-Orosa thereby necessitating the cancellation of said patent and its concomitant title in the name of respondent Anna Ramirez Lontok and now Rising Sun.[6]The CA held that the above statement, in conjunction with its allegations in the complaint that the heirs of Dr. Juanita Bartolome and Rizalina Sison (Spouses Bartolome) and their predecessors-in-interest have been in continuous and adverse possession of the subject property since time immemorial, indicates that the subject property is actually private in nature. Accordingly, the complaint filed by the Republic failed the test for the sufficiency of a cause of action.Hence, this petition for review on certiorari.IssueThe Republic, represented herein by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), submits the lone issue of whether the CA committed a reversible error in finding that the Republic failed to establish its cause of action.[7]The OSG maintains that the subject complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action because it contained allegations that respondent Anna Ramirez Lontok fraudulently acquired the property through a free patent. Since the State may dispose of property by awarding free patents, it follows that the subject realty originally formed part of the alienable and disposable land of the public domain. Hence, when Anna Ramirez Lontok fraudulently applied for and was irregularly awarded a free patent, the State can validly file an action for reversion under Section 91 of the Public Land Act.[8] Furthermore, the rule on indefeasibility of title shall not apply because the requirement of cultivation and occupation under the Public Land Act had not been satisfied.[9]Respondent Rising Sun counters that the Republic failed to state a cause of action as it admitted that the subject property is private and beyond the reach of an action for reversion. It also alleges that the said case was an attempt to resurrect the case filed by the heirs of Spouses Bartolome which had already been dismissed with prejudice.On the other hand, respondent Spouses Lontok failed to file their comment on the petition despite several notices issued by this Court.[10] Hence, We deemed the Spouses Lontok to have waived their right to file a comment.[11]May a complaint for annulment of patent and cancellation of title with prayer for reversion be dismissed if the subject property does not anymore belong to the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain?The Court's RulingWe find merit in the petition.The CA ruled in the assailed decision that the subject complaint failed to meet the test of sufficiency of cause of action. The CA noted the Republic's allegation that the Spouses Bartolome (from whom respondent Anna Ramirez Lontok purchased the contested lot) and their predecessors and successors-in­ interest, had been in continuous and adverse possession of the property since time immemorial. Since the subject property had acquired a private character due to the continued and adverse possession of the Spouses Bartolome and their predecessors-in-interest, the complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action.[12]The CA is partly mistaken.Failure to state a cause of action refers to the insufficiency of the pleading.[13] In determining whether an initiatory pleading states a cause of action, the test is whether admitting the truth of the facts alleged, can the court render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer?[14] Hence, only the allegations in the complaint may properly be considered.[15] Failure to make a sufficient allegation of a cause of action in the complaint \"warrants its dismissal.\"[16]To determine whether the CA and the RTC had been correct in ordering the dismissal of the complaint filed by the Republic, We have to review the allegations contained therein. Hence, We quote the pertinent averments made by the Republic in the subject complaint, viz.:10. On January 19, 1994, the heirs of spouses Juanita Armando and Rizalina Bartolome tiled a formal protest against the issuance of the aforesaid free patent and certificate of title alleging, among others, that the parcel of land applied for is a portion of Lot No. 97, Cad 427D, with a resultant area of 2,180 square meters which lot was surveyed in the name of Juanita Armando, protestants' father, during the cadastral survey of Victoria, Laguna in 1970, and that the protestants by themselves and thru their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject land since 1919 and that, consequently, defendant Anna Ramirez Lontok, misrepresented in her free patent application that she, by herself and her predecessor-in-interest, have occupied and cultivated the land since July 4, 1945.11. The protest was the subject of an administrative investigation conducted by Roberto S. Cortes, Jr., Chief of the Claims and Conflicts Section of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Region IV, Manila, who came out with the finding that subject patent and the corresponding original certificate of title were irregularly issued to, and fraudulently acquired by defendant Anna Ramirez Lontok in that:a) Lot 97-A is a portion of a bigger lot, Lot 97, Cad 427- D, with a resultant area of 2,180 square meters, which lot was surveyed in the name of Juanito Armando, protestants' father, during the cadastral survey of Victoria, Laguna in 1970.b) Juani\n",

      "Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari[1] are the Decision[2] dated November 27, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated March 10, 2020 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 42150, which affirmed the Decision[4] dated July 27, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx (RTC) in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-17-02854-CR, finding petitioner Melvin Encinares y Ballon (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 10 (a) of Republic Act No. (RA) 7610,[5] otherwise known as the \"Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.\"The FactsThe instant case stemmed from an Information charging petitioner with violation of Section 10 (a)[6] of RA 7610, which reads:  That on or about the 27th day of December 2011, in xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of child abuse prejudicial to the development and welfare of one [AAA], a minor, 16 years old, by then and there placing the latter's penis in his mouth and played (sic) with it, which acts debases, degrades or demeans (sic) the intrinsic worth and dignity of said [AAA], as a human being, to his damage and prejudice.CONTRARY TO LAW.[7]The prosecution alleged that petitioner was the Vice President of the xxxxxxxxxxx High School General Parents Teachers Association while AAA,[8] then sixteen (16) years old, was the Citizenship Advancement Training (CAT) Corps Commander. Sometime between October and November 2011, petitioner approached Perla R. Ragadio (Ragadio), the school's CAT Commandant, to offer help with the t-shirts and other items that the CAT might need, which the latter accepted. Thereafter, Ragadio asked AAA to follow-up the items they ordered from petitioner. Because of this, AAA and petitioner became text mates. Petitioner would send AAA cellphone load and even offered him \"ATM, GSIS, and SSS pensions.\"[9]In the evening of December 27, 2011, petitioner invited AAA to a drinking spree in his house. Although AAA does not drink alcohol, petitioner offered him one. Later that night, petitioner told him to sleep in the bedroom since there were no more available means of transportation for AAA to go home. While AAA was sleeping, petitioner put AAA's penis into his mouth and played with it for ten (10) minutes. AAA tried to resist but failed since he was too drunk.[10] Consequently, an Information charging petitioner with violation of Section 10 (a) of RA 7610 was filed before the RTC.In defense, petitioner denied the charges against him and instead, claimed that he was friends with AAA, who would often ask him for favors such as cellphone load and money. Petitioner averred that on the date and time of the alleged incident, AAA asked permission to sleep in his (petitioner's) house, to which he agreed. AAA arrived at 11 o'clock in the evening while petitioner was watching television with his family. Petitioner then told AAA to sleep in the sofa. He denied that there was a drinking spree at that time and asserted that it was impossible for him to do anything to AAA as there were other persons in the house and the lights were switched on so that he could constantly check on his sick child. He further alleged that AAA was just prodded by his uncle, BBB, to file a case against him to extort money.[11]As additional defense witnesses, Erlinda Galiano testified that she witnessed AAA, who was unassisted by a guardian, sign a handwritten affidavit of withdrawal, recantation, and desistance. Likewise, Rizaldy Sidayon, President of Sitio Ruby Neighborhood Association, Inc., issued a Certification dated June 14, 2012 stating that petitioner was a role model to the youth through his strong moral values. Punong Barangay Jose Arnel Quebal issued a similar Certification dated July 24, 2012.[12]The RTC RulingIn a Decision[13] dated July 27, 2018, the RTC found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 10 (a) of RA 7610, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of indeterminate imprisonment of four (4) years, nine (9) months, and eleven (11) days of prision correccional, as minimum, to six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum, and to pay the costs of suit.[14] It found that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the crime charged and gave weight to the positive, direct, spontaneous, and candid testimony of AAA, who positively identified petitioner as the perpetrator. On the other hand, the RTC rejected petitioner's defense that it was impossible for him to commit said crime as other people were present that time, ratiocinating that lust respects no time and place. As to the letter and affidavit of withdrawal, recantation, and desistance executed by AAA, the RTC stressed that when the latter executed the same, he was still a minor and not assisted by a guardian. Moreover, the letter was not presented before the investigating prosecutor during the preliminary investigation. Finally, the RTC found that petitioner failed to come up with a plausible explanation as to why AAA would file false charges against him.[15]Aggrieved, petitioner appealed[16] to the CA.The CA RulingIn a Decision[17] dated November 27, 2019, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling, concurring with its finding that the prosecution was able to sufficiently establish all the elements of the crime charged. It refused to give credence to petitioner's unsubstantiated defenses of denial and alibi, and instead affirmed the findings of the RTC as regards the credibility of the prosecution witness, there being no reason to disturb said findings. Finally, it reiterated the doctrine that lust is no respecter of time and space, since rape can even be committed in places where other family members are sleeping.[18]Dissatisfied, petitioner moved for reconsideration,[19] which was denied in a Resolution[20] dated March 10, 2020; hence, the present petition.The Issue Before the CourtThe issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in convicting petitioner of the crime of violation of Section 10 (a) of RA 7610, as charged.The Court's RulingTime and again, it has been held that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment, whether assigned or unassigned. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.[21]Guided by this consideration, the Court finds that based on the established facts and evidence offered in this case, petitioner's conviction should be for a violation of Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, instead of Section 10 (a) of the same Act.The pertinent provisions of Sections 5 (b) and 10 (a) of RA 7610 respectively state:Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. - Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:xxx(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period[.] x x xSection 10. Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development. -(a) Any person who shall commit any other acts of child abuse, cruelty or exploitation or be responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the penalty of prision mayor in its minimum period. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)As can be gleaned from the above-mentioned provisions, Section 5 (b) of RA 7610 specifically applies in cases of sexual abuse committed against children, which includes lascivious conduct; whereas, Section 10 (a) thereof punishes other forms of child abuse not covered by particular provisions of RA 7610. Evidently, the offense will not fall within the purview of Section 10 (a) of RA 7610 if the same is specifically penalized by a particular provision, such as Section 5 (b). The term \"lascivious conduct\" was given a specific definition in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 7610, viz.: \"the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person.\"[22]In light of the clear definition of the term vis-a-vis the evidence presented in this case, the Court finds that petitioner's acts of putting AAA's penis inside his mouth and playing with it for ten (10) minutes constitute Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610. As such, it was an error for the courts a quo to have convicted him under Section 10 (a) of the same Act. True, the Information filed against petitioner charged him under Section 10 (a) of RA 7610. However, it is a well-settled rule that \"the nature and character of the crime charged are determined not by the specification of the provision of the law alleged to have been violated but by the facts alleged in the indictment, that is, the actual recital of the facts as alleged in the body of the information, and not the caption or preamble of the information or complaint nor the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, they being conclusions of law. The facts alleged in the body of the information, not the technical name given by the prosecutor appearing in the title of the information, determine the character of the crime.\"[23] Further, the information must sufficiently allege the acts or omissions complained of to inform a person of common understanding what offense he is being charged with - in other words, the elements of the crime must be clearly stated.[24]A perusal of the Information filed against petitioner in this case discloses that it is sufficient to charge him with Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, as it reads:That on or about the 27th day of December 2011, in xxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of child abuse prejudicial to the development and welfare of one [AAA], a minor, 16 years old, by then and there placing the latter's penis in his mouth and played (sic) with it, which acts debases, degrades or demeans (sic) the intrinsic worth and dignity of said [AAA], as a human being, to his damage and prejudice.CONTRARY TO LAW.[25]Here, as both the recital in the Information and the evidence presented by the prosecution provide for a case that can be prosecuted and penalized as Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, petitioner should be properly convicted and penalized therefor.Due to the modification of petitioner's conviction, a change in the imposable penalty, as well as the awards of damages, is in order. The prescribed penalty for violation of Section 5 (b) of RA 7610 is reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua. In the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the maximum term of the sentence shall be taken from the medium period of the prescribed penalty. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that RA 7610 is a special law, petitioner may still enjoy the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. In applying its provisions, the minimum term shall be taken from within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, which is prision mayor in its medium period to reclusion temporal in its minimum period. Thus, petitioner is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, for violation of Section 5 (b) of RA 7610.Finally, and conformably with the ruling in People v. Tulagan,[26] the amount of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages awarded for Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, where the victim is a child below eighteen (18) years of age and the penalty imposed is within the range of reclusion temporal medium, is P50,000.00 each.WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 27, 2019 and the Resolution dated March 10, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 42150 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, finding petitioner Melvin Encinares y Bailon GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610. Accordingly, he is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of this Decision until full payment.SO ORDERED.Gesmundo, Lazaro-Javier, Lopez, and Rosario,* JJ., concur.* Designated Additional Member per Special Order No. 2797 dated November 5, 2020.[1] Rollo, pp. 12-26.[2] Id. at 30-39.

      "The present administrative case arose from a verified Sumbong Salaysay[1] filed by complainant Dolores De Vera (Dolores) against respondent Atty. Cenon J. Navarro (Atty. Navarro) for his alleged failure to furnish the Archive Office of Malolos City, Bulacan a copy of the Affidavit of Acknowledgment and Use of Surname[2] (Affidavit) executed by Dolores' deceased husband, Manuel De Vera, Jr. (Manuel) on August 7, 2007.The FactsDolores alleged that in 1996, she gave birth to her daughter, Donna Belle, at the Fabella Hospital in Manila. However, because Dolores and Manuel, Donna Belle's biological father, were yet to be married, the child had to use Dolores' maiden name, \"Angeles.\" It was two (2) years later or in 1998 when Dolores and Manuel were finally able to get married.[3]Sometime in July 2007, Dolores discovered that Donna Belle's Certificate of Live Birth[4] on record at the National Statistics Office[5] (NSO) did not reflect her first name, as only her middle initial \"V\" and last name \"Angeles\" appeared thereon. Thus, Dolores and Manuel secured the services of Atty. Navarro, who, after receiving due consideration, prepared the Affidavit, which he notarized on August 7, 2007. In the Affidavit, Manuel acknowledged that Donna Belle was his illegitimate child with Dolores and that he was giving his full consent to use his surname as provided by law.Years later, or in 2016, Dolores and Donna Belle secured a copy of the latter's Certificate of Live Birth from the Civil Registrar of Manila for purposes of working abroad. After requiring Donna Belle to accomplish some standard forms, the officer-in-charge at the Civil Registrar of Manila informed her that the copy of her Affidavit should be a certified true copy of the original on file at the Archive Office in Malolos or the Main Archive Office.Unfortunately, when they secured a certified true copy of the Affidavit, it contained a Certification[6] dated June 16, 2016 issued by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos City, Bulacan, which stated thus:This is to certify that upon verification from the Notarial report submitted by Atty. Cenon J. Navarro for the month of August 2007, the document entitled 'Aftidavit of Acknowledgment and Use of Surname' with Doc. No. 27, Page No. 7, Book No. CXXXI, Series of 2007 is not included in the aforementioned monthly report.[7] (Emphases supplied)Aggrieved, Dolores lodged a complaint[8] against Atty. Navarro before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Bulacan Chapter. On the third scheduled mediation hearing,[9] Atty. Navarro told Dolores that he was willing to financially assist her in filing a case for the correction of the entry in Donna Belle's birth certificate. After allegedly haggling over the price, the parties settled on the amount of P55,000.00, which Dolores received in several cash installments.[10] Thereafter, despite several attempts, Dolores failed to contact Atty. Navarro; hence, this administrative complaint.In defense, Atty. Navarro denied notarizing the Affidavit and claimed that the signature thereon was different from his own. Further, he insisted that Dolores should produce the original copy of the Affidavit that he purportedly notarized. He averred that she was conspiring with other persons to harass him considering that it took nine (9) long years before she decided to rectify the error in her daughter's birth certificate. Finally, while he admitted having offered monetary support to Dolores, the latter should not take advantage by making unreasonable demands.The IBP's Report and RecommendationIn a Report and Recommendation[11] dated November 16, 2017, the IBP Commissioner found Atty. Navarro guilty of lack of diligence for failing to perform services causing serious injury to his client and recommended that he be suspended for a period of one (1) year from the practice of law, with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.[12] The IBP Commissioner found Dolores' allegations more credible than Atty. Navarro's denial, positing that the former would not consider going to the Archive Office of Malolos City if she had no idea what she was requesting for. Further, if it were true that Atty. Navarro's signature on the Affidavit was a forgery as he claimed, it is curious how Dolores was able to obtain the notarial details reflected on the document. Likewise, Dolores cannot be faulted if she took steps to rectify the error in Donna Belle's birth certificate only after nine (9) years considering that it was only then that her daughter found the need to secure a copy of her birth certificate for purposes of employment abroad. Finally, the IBP Commissioner found it significant that Atty. Navarro offered pecuniary assistance to Dolores notwithstanding his denials.[13]In a Resolution[14] dated July 1, 2018, the IBP Board of Governors adopted the findings of fact and recommendation of the IBP Commissioner with the modification reducing the period of suspension from the practice of law to one (1) month. Atty. Navarro moved for reconsideration thereof, which was denied in the IBP Board of Governors' Resolution[15] dated June 17, 2019. Hence, this petition.[16]The Issue Before the CourtThe sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not grounds exist to hold Atty. Navarro administratively liable in this case.The Court's RulingAfter a judicious review of the records, the Court concurs with the findings and recommendations of the IBP Commissioner that Atty. Navarro should be held administratively liable in this case.The act of notarization is not an ordinary routine but is imbued with substantive public interest.[17] A notary public is empowered to perform a variety of notarial acts, most common of which are the acknowledgment and affirmation of documents or instruments. In the performance of these notarial acts, the notary public must be mindful of the significance of the notarial seal affixed on documents. The notarial seal converts a document from a private to a public instrument, after which it may be presented as evidence without need of proof of its genuineness and due execution.[18] A notarized document is entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. Thus, a notary public should observe utmost care in performing his duties to preserve public confidence in the integrity of notarized documents.[19]The Court has examined the original copy[20] of the Affidavit that Atty. Navarro denied notarizing and finds the same to be regular and valid on its face, bearing as it does his notarial seal, notarial details, and signature. On this score, and as aptly pointed out by the IBP Commissioner, if Atty. Navarro's signature thereon was forged as he maintains, the question of where and how Dolores was able to obtain the notarial details remains. More importantly, the Affidavit is evidently stamped with Atty. Navarro's notarial seal, an irrefutable and concrete evidence of notarization.The 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, particularly Rule VI thereof, is explicit on the duties and obligations of the notary public with respect to entries in the Notarial Register, as follows:RULE VINOTARIAL REGISTERSECTION 1. Form of Notarial Register. - (a) A notary public shall keep, maintain, protect and provide for lawful inspection as provided in these Rules, a chronological official notarial register of notarial acts consisting of a permanently bound book with numbered pages.x x x xSEC. 2. Entries in the Notarial Register. - (a) For every notarial act, the notary shall record in the notarial register at the time of notarization the following: (1) the entry number and page number;(2) the date and time of day of the notarial act;(3) the type or notarial act;(4) the title or description of the instrument, document or proceeding;(5) the name and address of each principal;(6) the competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules if the signatory is not personally known to the notary;(7) the name and address of each credible witness swearing to or affirming the person's identity;(8) the fee charged for the notarial act;(9) the address where the notarization was performed if not in the notary's regular place of work or business; and(10) any other circumstance the notary public may deem or significance or relevance.x x x x(e) The notary public shall give to each instrument or document executed, sworn to, or acknowledged before him a number corresponding to the one in his register, and shall also state on the instrument or document the page/s of his register on which the same is recorded. No blank line shall be left between entries.x x x x(g) At the end of each week, the notary public shall certify in his notarial register the number of instruments or documents executed, sworn to, or acknowledged, or protested before him; or if none, this certificate shall show this fact. (Emphasis supplied)As certified by the Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC in Malolos City, Bulacan, the Affidavit which Atty. Navarro notarized and bore his notarial seal was not included in the latter's report for the month of August 2007. Given the evidentiary value accorded to notarized documents, Atty. Navarro's failure to record the document in his notarial register corresponds to falsely making it appear that the document was notarized when, in fact, it was not.[21] \"If the document or instrument does not appear in the notarial records and there is no copy of it therein, doubt is engendered that the document or instrument was not really notarized, so that it is not a public document and cannot bolster any claim made based on this document.\"[22] It cannot be overemphasized that notaries public are urged to observe with utmost care and utmost fidelity the basic requirements in the performance of their duties; otherwise, the confidence of the public in the integrity of notarized deeds will be undermined.[23]Indubitably, Atty. Navarro was remiss in his duties as a notary public, causing prejudice and injury not only to Dolores but more importantly, to Donna Belle, whose Certificate of Live Birth contained inaccuracies when she needed the same for employment purposes. Undeniably, this failure on the part of Atty. Navarro constitutes a transgression of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, for which he must be held administratively liable.In a number of cases, the Court has subjected lawyers who were remiss in their duties as notaries public to disciplinary sanction. Failure to enter the notarial acts in one's notarial register, as in this case, constitutes dereliction of a notary public's duties which warrants the revocation of a lawyer's commission as a notary public.[24] In the cases of Malvar v. Buleros[25] and Bartolome v. Basilio,[26] where the notaries public committed similar violations of the Notarial Rules such as failure to record a notarized document in their respective notarial registers, the Court meted out the penalty of revocation of notarial commission, disqualification for two (2) years from being appointed as a notary public, and suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months. Finding the same infraction to have been committed by Atty. Navarro in this case, the Court deems it proper to impose the same penalty upon him.WHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Cenon J. Navarro (Atty. Navarro) is found GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Accordingly, he is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, effective upon receipt of this Decision. Moreover, his notarial commission, if any, is hereby IMMEDIATELY REVOKED, and he is DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two (2) years.Atty. Navarro is DIRECTED to immediately file a manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi­ judicial bodies where he had entered his appearance as counsel.Let copies of this Decision be furnished to: (1) the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to Atty. Navarro's personal record as an attorney; (2) the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and (3) the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.SO ORDERED.Gesmundo, Lazaro-Javier, and Lopez, JJ., concur.Rosario,* J., on official leave.* Designated Additional Member per Special Order No. 2797 dated November 5, 2020.

      "PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:\n",
      "In a Resolution[1] dated October 10, 2018, the Court affirmed the Amended Decision[2] dated August 25, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR. No. 36063 and found petitioner Emilio J. Aguinaldo IV (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315 (2) (a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), the pertinent portion of which reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Amended Decision dated August 25, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR. No. 36063, finding petitioner Emilio J. Aguinaldo IV guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code, is hereby AFFIRMED.[3]Verily, the assailed CA Amended Decision sentenced petitioner to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of four (4) years and two (2) months of prison correccional, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal, as maximum,[4] but deleted the awards of actual damages and interest due to petitioner's payment of the judgment award in the amount of P2,050,000.00 which was duly acknowledged by the private complainant.[5]Aggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration,[6] which was denied with finality in a Resolution[7] dated January 14, 2019. The said Resolution came with a directive that \"[n]o further pleadings or motions shall be entertained in this case. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately.\"[8] Accordingly, Entry of Judgment[9] was issued on even date.The foregoing notwithstanding, petitioner still filed the following motions, namely: (a) Omnibus Motion (1) For Leave to File Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration; (2) To Refer Case to the Honorable Court En Banc; and (3) For Second Reconsideration[10] dated March 20, 2019; and (b) Urgent Motion for Recomputation of Penalty[11] dated March 9, 2020. Essentially, the first motion insists on petitioner's innocence and prays for his acquittal from the crime charged; whereas the second motion prays that petitioner's sentence be readjusted in accordance with Republic Act No. (RA) 10951.[12]In a Resolution[13] dated July 27, 2020, the Court, inter alia, required petitioner's counsel to submit petitioner's prison record. However, in a Manifestation and Compliance[14] dated September 4, 2020, petitioner informed the Court that he is on bail pending appeal, and therefore, not confined in any prison.The Court now resolves.At the outset, it must be noted that by virtue of the Entry of Judgment issued on January 14, 2019, petitioner's conviction for Estafa had become final and executory; and hence, immutable. In Uy v. Del Castillo,[15] the Court explained the doctrine of immutability of judgment as follows:Time and again, the Court has repeatedly held that \"a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and whether it be made by the court that rendered it or by the Highest Court of the land. This principle, known as the doctrine of immutability of judgment, has a two-fold purpose, namely: (a) to avoid delay in the administration of justice and thus, procedurally, to make orderly the discharge of judicial business; and (b) to put an end to judicial controversies, at the risk of occasional errors, which is precisely why courts exist. Verily, it fosters the judicious perception that the rights and obligations of every litigant must not hang in suspense for an indefinite period of time. As such, it is not regarded as a mere technicality to be easily brushed aside, but rather, a matter of public policy which must be faithfully complied.\" However, this doctrine \"is not a hard and fast rule as the Court has the power and prerogative to relax the same in order to serve the demands of substantial justice considering: (a) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property; (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (c) the merits of the case; (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (e) the lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; and (f) that the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.\"[16]Anent the first motion, suffice it to say that the Court finds that the issues raised therein are but mere reiterations of the grounds already evaluated and passed upon in the Assailed Resolution. Therefore, there is no cogent reason to warrant an application of any of the exceptions to the doctrine of immutability of judgment in order to reverse petitioner's conviction for Estafa.On the other hand, the second motion merely asks that the Court readjust petitioner's prison sentence in accordance with RA 10951 which was enacted in 2017. As may be gleaned from the law's title, it adjusted the value of the property and the amount of damages on which various penalties are based, taking into consideration the present value of money, as opposed to its archaic values when the RPC was enacted in 1932. While it is conceded that petition committed the crime for which he was convicted way before the enactment of RA 10951, this law expressly provides for retroactive effect if it is favorable to the accused.[17]To recall, petitioner was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa for having defrauded private complainant in the amount of P2,050,000.00. As such, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of four (4) years and two (2) months of prison correccional, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal, as maximum. Notably, the computation of this penalty was based on the schedule of penalties stated in Article 315 of the RPC, prior to the enactment of RA 10951. However, due to the enactment of RA 10951 - which readjusted the graduated values for which the penalties for Estafa are based ­ the prescribed penalty for Estafa involving the aforementioned defrauded amount was significantly lowered, as follows:SECTION 85. Article 315 of the same Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is hereby further amended to read as follows:x x x x\"2nd. The penalty of prision correccional in its minimum and medium periods, if the amount of the fraud is over One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000) but does not exceed Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000).x x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)At this juncture, it is well to stress that in Bigler v. People (Bigler),[18] the Court ruled that notwithstanding the finality of a criminal conviction, it still has the power to correct the penalty imposed against an accused-convict, if it finds the same to be outside the range prescribed by law. In this regard, the Court further elucidated that \"a sentence which imposes upon the defendant in a criminal prosecution a penalty in excess of the maximum which the court is authorized by law to impose for the offense for which the defendant was convicted, is void for want or excess of jurisdiction as to the excess.\"[19]Thus, in view of the Court's pronouncement in Bigler, the provisions of RA 10951, the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and considering further the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the proper penalty to be imposed on petitioner should be four (4) months and twenty (20) days of arresto mayor, as minimum, to two (2) years, eleven (11) months, and ten (10) days of prision correccional, as maximum.In sum, the Court deems it proper to lift the Entry of Judgment dated January 14, 2019 in order to modify the penalty imposed on petitioner as explained above. Notably, this reduction of penalty entitles petitioner to apply for probation, pursuant to RA 10707,[20] which allows an accused-convict to apply for probation in the event that he/she is sentenced to a non-probationable penalty by the trial court but subsequently modified by the appellate court to a probationable penalty,[21] viz.:SECTION 1. Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 968, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:\"SEC. 4. Grant of Probation. -Subject to the provisions of this Decree, the trial court may, after it shall have convicted and sentenced a defendant for a probationable penalty and upon application by said defendant within the period for perfecting an appeal, suspend the execution of the sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as it may deem best. No application for probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected the appeal from the judgment of conviction: Provided,That when a judgment of conviction imposing a non-probationable penalty is appealed or reviewed, and such judgment is modified through the imposition of a probationable penalty, the defendant shall be allowed to apply for probation based on the modified decision before such decision becomes final. The application for probation based on the modified decision shall be filed in the trial court where the judgment of conviction imposing a non-probationable penalty was rendered, or in the trial court where such case has since been re-raffled. In a case involving several defendants where some have taken further appeal, the other defendants may apply for probation by submitting a written application and attaching thereto a certified true copy of the judgment of conviction.x x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)WHEREFORE, petitioner Emilio J. Aguinaldo IV's (petitioner) Omnibus Motion (1) For Leave to File Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration; (2) To Refer Case to the Honorable Court En Banc; and (3) For Second Reconsideration dated March 20, 2019 is DENIED for lack of merit.On the other hand, petitioner's Urgent Motion for Recomputation of Penalty dated March 9, 2020 is GRANTED.

No. 9165), otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, for unlawful possession of 21.07 grams of shabu and illegal possession of drug paraphernalia, which cases were docketed before the RTC as Criminal Case Nos. 35-5586 and 35-5587, respectively.When arraigned, Policarpio pleaded not guilty to all the three charges.[3] After pre-trial was terminated, a joint trial on the merits followed.Version of the ProsecutionTo substantiate its charges against Policarpio, the prosecution presented Intelligence Officer 3 Dexter Asayco (IO3 Asayco) of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), PDEA Agent Seymoure Darius Sanchez (Agent Sanchez), Barangay Chairman Glesie L. Tangonan (Barangay Chairman Tangonan) and Forensic Chemical Officer Roda Agcaoili (Forensic Chemist Agcaoili) of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory, Tuguegarao City, as its witnesses.IO3 Asayco testified that he was a member of the PDEA team that implemented Search Warrant No. 0085 at the house of Policarpio located at No. 29 Purok 4, Barangay Malvar, Santiago City on April 12, 2007 at about 12 o'clock noon. The PDEA agents knocked on the door of Policarpio's house, and when Policarpio came out, their team leader, Police Senior Inspector Jaime De Vera (PSI De Vera) read to him the contents of the search warrant and gave him a copy thereof. The search of the house was conducted by him and agent Sanchez in the presence of accused-appellant's mother, Perla Policarpio, Barangay Chairman Tangonan and Barangay Kagawad Ohmar Zodiac Calimag. Policarpio was outside the house when the search was being conducted. In the process of implementing the search warrant, they confiscated nine (9) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance suspected to be methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, eleven (11) deposit slips and cash in the total amount of P17,700.00, which were all found inside a blue clutch bag; several pieces of drug paraphernalia, which were found in between the dura box and the wall of the room; and one (1) .45 caliber Colt pistol bearing Serial No. 452857 with magazine and live ammunitions, found beneath the bed cushion. The confiscated items were marked with IO3 Asayco's and agent Sanchez' initials before turning them over to their Chief Investigator Danilo Natividad (CI Natividad). The marking was done at the room of Policarpio in the presence of said accused, his mother, the barangay officials, the media and CI Natividad. He placed his initials \"DBA\" as his marking on the seized items. Policarpio signed the confiscation receipts at the place of search in the presence of his mother, the media and the operating team. The other witnesses also affixed their signatures on the confiscation receipts. Policarpio was immediately arrested and apprised of his constitutional rights.[4]Agent Sanchez corroborated the testimony of IO3 Asayco in its material points and added that he placed his initials \"SDS\" on the seized items. He clarified that Jay-R Policarpio alias Dagul, indicated in the search warrant as the name of the subject thereof, and Ely Policarpio are one and the same person. He recounted that their team leader, PSI De Vera, already knew the exact address of Policarpio even before the implementation of the search warrant. Also, the barangay officials pointed to them the house of Policarpio. He recalled that Policarpio did not show any form of resistance during the implementation of the search warrant against him, and gave no reaction when they showed him the items seized. After marking the confiscated items, he turned over the same to their Chief Investigator, SPO1 Natividad, in the presence of Policarpio and the barangay officials.[5]When Barangay Chairman Tangonan was called to the witness stand, the prosecution and the defense entered into a stipulation that she was present during the inventory of the confiscated items and that she signed the confiscation receipt. Afterwhich, the trial court dispensed with her testimony.[6]The testimony of Forensic Chemist Agcaoili was, likewise, dispensed with after the parties stipulated that: (1) the nine (9) plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance, subject matter in Criminal Case No. 35-5586 for illegal possession of shabu, were submitted to her for examination on April 12, 2007; (2) the nine (9) plastic sachets with white crystalline substance tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu; and (3) her findings were reflected in Chemistry Report No. D-20-2007.[7]Thereafter, the prosecution rested its case and formally offered its documentary evidence, among which is Search Warrant No. 0085.It appears that on April 11, 2007, Executive Judge Efren M. Cacatian of the RTC, Branch 35, of Santiago City, Isabela issued Search Warrant No. 0085,[8] on the strength of the testimonies of PSI De Vera of the PDEA and of a certain Fred Manabat. The search warrant reads:TO ANY OFFICER OF THE LAW:Greetings:It appearing to the satisfaction of the Court after examining under oath the witnesses Fred Manabat and PSI Jaime De Vera that there is a probable cause to believe that Jay-R Policarpio @ Dagul of Purok 4, Malvar, Santiago City committed and that there are good and sufficient reasons to believe that the respondent has in possession and control the following items:  a.) Undetermined quantity of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride known as shabu;b.) Several drug paraphernalia used in repacking shabu.NOW THEREFORE, you are hereby commanded to make an immediate search at any time in the day of the house of the respondent stated above and forthwith seize and take possession of the above-described grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride known as shabu and drug paraphernalia, bring them before me to be dealt with as the law directs.SO ORDERED.Version of the DefensePolicarpio vehemently denied the charges against him. He narrated that on April 12, 2007 at 6 o'clock in the morning, he was awakened by knocks on the door of his house located at No. 29 Purok 4, Barangay Malvar, Santiago City. He claimed that he is a resident of said address since birth. When he opened the door, two (2) police officers pointed their guns at him. The police officers then ordered him, his wife and children to go out of the house. And thereafter, the police officers asked him if he is Junior Policarpio, to which query he answered in the negative because his name is Ely Policarpio. They asked him to sign a search warrant and then they entered his house. The contents of the search warrant were not explained to him. When the police officers were done searching his house, they showed him something, but he had no idea what it was and where it came from. After a while, Barangay Chairman Tangonan arrived and signed a document. Thereafter, he was brought to the police station and later on, to the court. He denied having signed a confiscation receipt. He alleged that her mother, Perla Policarpio, was not a resident of his house at the time the search was conducted.[9]The RTC RulingOn October 15, 2013, the RTC rendered a Joint Decision[10] finding Policarpio guilty of all the three charges, the dispositive portion of which reads:WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as follows:1)  In Criminal Case No. 35-5586, for possession of illegal drugs whereby he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND (Php400,000.00) PESOS;2) In Criminal Case No. 35-5587, for possession of drug paraphernalia, whereby he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of SIX (6) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY and a fine of TEN THOUSAND (Php10,000.00) PESOS; and3) In Criminal Case No. 35-5585, for violation of the Comelec gun ban, whereby he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of ONE (1) YEAR.SO ORDERED.[11]The RTC ruled that the search of Policarpio's house was legal because the same was done by virtue of a valid search warrant and hence, the items seized are admissible in evidence against him. Anent the confiscated .45 caliber pistol, the RTC declared that Policarpio's possession thereof was in clear violation of the COMELEC Gun Ban. The RTC held that the prosecution adduced sufficient evidence to established beyond cavil of a doubt the guilt of Policarpio of the three crimes charged against him.Not in conformity, Policarpio appealed the RTC verdict of conviction before the Court of Appeals (CA), which was docketed therein as CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 06648.The CA RulingOn August 18, 2016, the CA rendered its assailed Decision[12] affirming the conviction of Policarpio for Violation of Sections 11 and 12, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. It declared that all the elements of illegal possession of shabu and of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia were adequately proven by the prosecution. It rejected the appellant's argument that the prosecution failed to establish the factual details which constituted the essential elements of the crimes charged. The CA opined that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized narcotics were not compromised because the chain of custody of the same remained unbroken. It upheld the validity of Search Warrant No. 0085 and, thus, the illegal drugs and pieces of drug paraphernalia confiscated by virtue thereof are admissible in evidence against Policarpio. It debunked the defense of denial interposed by Policarpio for being negative and self-serving evidence. The CA, however, acquitted Policarpio of Violation of Section 261(q) of the Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines. In the end, the CA decreed:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated 15 October 2013 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that accused-appellant Ely Policarpio is ACQUITTED of violation of Section 261(q) of the Omnibus Election Code in Criminal Case No. 35-5585.SO ORDERED.[13]The IssuesUnpe1turbed, Policarpio filed the present appeal and posited the same assignment of errors he previously raised before the CA, to wit:ITHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY DESPITE THE APPARENT VIOLATION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEARCH WARRANT.IITHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT FOR VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 261 OF BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 881; SECTION 11, ARTICLE II, OF R.A. NO. 9165; AND SECTION 12, ARTICLE II, OF R.A. NO. 9165.IIITHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE WITH CERTAINTY THE CORPUS DELICTI OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED.[14]On April 5, 2017, the Court issued a Resolution[15] dismissing Policarpio's appeal for his failure to sufficiently show reversible error in the assailed decision of the CA. The fallo of which reads:WHEREFORE, the Court ADOPTS the finding of fact and conclusion of law of the Court of Appeals in its August 18, 2016 Decision in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06648, finding accused-appellant, Ely Policarpio y Natividad a.k.a. \"Dagul,\" GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 11 and 12, Article II, Republic Act No. 9165 with MODIFICATION in that accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) months and one (1) day, as minimum, to three (3) years, as maximum, in Criminal Case No. 35-5587.SO ORDERED.[16]Undaunted, Policarpio filed the present Motion for Reconsideration, insisting on his innocence of violation of Sections 11 and 12 of R.A. No. 9165. He contends anew that Search Warrant No. 0085 is invalid because it failed to specify the exact address of the place to be searched as well the items to be seized. Further, Policarpio maintains that the searching officers failed to comply with the procedure laid down in Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 because: (1) the allegedly seized items were not photographed immediately after confiscation and seizure, or even thereafter; and (2) the inventory of the allegedly seized items were not conducted in the presence of a representative of the media and DOJ officials. He assails the prosecution evidence for its failure to establish the proper chain of custody of the subject plastic sachets of shabu and drug paraphernalia. Policarpio concludes that he is entitled to acquittal of the foregoing charges leveled against him.The Court's RulingAfter a second hard look on the evidence on record, the Court finds that the Motion for Reconsideration is partially meritorious. Policarpio's conviction for Violation of Sections 11 and 12, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 must be reversed.Inceptively, the Court is in complete accord with the ruling of the CA that Search Warrant No. 0085 is valid. We note that Policarpio had previously raised the contention that the search warrant is invalid and fatally defective in his Motion to Quash Search Warrant and/or Suppression of Evidence[17] filed before the RTC which was subsequently denied by the said trial court in its Resolution[18] dated September 4, 2008. The Court similarly concludes that there was compliance with the constitutional requirement that there be a particular description of \"the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.A description of a place to be searched is sufficient if the officer with the warrant can, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify the place intended and distinguish it from other places in the community. Any designation or description known to the locality that points out the place to the exclusion of all others, and on inquiry leads the officers unerringly to it, satisfies the constitutional requirement.[19]In the case at bench, while the address stated in Search Warrant No. 0085 is merely \"Purok 4, Malvar, Santiago City,\" the deponents in the application for the search warrant, namely, Fred Manabat and PSI De Vera, were able to provide an outline of the location of Policarpio's house sufficient to distinguish it from other houses in Purok 4, Malvar Santiago City and, hence, there was no doubt as to the location of the intended subject of the search and seizure operation. Also, before the PDEA team proceeded to the house of Policarpio, they first coordinated with the barangay officials who accompanied the team to the house of said appellant. It is safe to presume that these barangay officials are familiar with the residents of Barangay Malvar, including Policarpio, who had resided therein since birth. More importantly, it appears that PSI De Vera knew the exact address of the appellant even prior to April 12, 2007 and he actually led the raiding team in the implementation of the search warrant. These, in the Court's view, are sufficient enough for the officers to, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify the place to be searched, which they in fact did. Verily, the deficiency in the address stated in the search warrant is not of sufficient gravity that would spell the invalidation thereof.The Court, likewise, finds that Search Warrant No. 0085 has satisfied the requirement on particularity of description of the items to be seized.A search warrant may be said to particularly describe the things to be seized when the description therein is as specific as the circumstances will ordinarily allow; or when the description expresses a conclusion of fact ­ not of law - by which the warrant officer may be guided in making the search and seizure; or when the things described are limited to those which bear direct relation to the offense for which the warrant is being issued.[20] In People v. Tee,[21] the Court wrote:Thus, it has been held that term \"narcotics paraphernalia\" is not so wanting in particularity as to create a general warrant. Nor is the description \"any and all narcotics\" and \"all implements, paraphernalia, articles, papers and records pertaining to\" the use, possession, or sale of narcotics or dangerous drugs so broad as to be unconstitutional. A search warrant commanding peace officers to seize \"a quantity of loose heroin\" has been held sufficient\n",

The testimony of these witnesses similarly involved a narration of the assignment of a service vehicle, investigation by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) Office concerning repairs made on the said vehicle, and a statement denying, not recognizing and/or not authorizing some or all of the said repairs made as described in the DVs.[44]Among the prosecution's witnesses was Ramoncito C. Jimenez (Jimenez), who testified that since 1999 up to present (i.e., the time of his testimony), he was the Project Manager 1 at the ADB Project Monitoring Office of the DPWH. In 1999, he was issued a brand new service vehicle, a Mitsubishi L200 Pick-up with Plate No. SFG 496. This vehicle, under his directive, was previously subjected to maintenance service and repairs for four times. He was surprised when petitioner Dela Cruz, the owner of DEB, presented a DV and other documents for him to sign, allegedly for the payment of the repairs in the amount of P22,420.00. While he was at first hesitant because he did not give any advance payment for the service and repairs, he agreed to sign the DV. The IAS Office showed six DVs with six checks covering repairs on his service vehicle reportedly done by J-CAP, but the signatory in the DVs are co-accused Martinez and Arias, instead of witness Jimenez as end-user. In these alleged transactions, there were no actual repairs or services done on his service vehicle.[45]The Sandiganbayan summarized the defenses raised by petitioners:MAXIMO A. BORJE testified that in 2001, he was the Chief of Motor Pool at the Bureau of Equipment (BOE), DPWH. He is primarily in charge with the administration of the Motor Pool Office. A request for repair begins when the request is relayed to the secretary of the Motor Pool who then relays said request to the Special Inspectorate Team (SIT). The SIT conducts the pre-inspection repair and thereafter prepares the Job Order. The SIT will then inform him of the parts needed for repair. He recommends the approval of the Job Order. It is the Chief of the Central Equipment and Spare Parts Division, Erdito Quarto, who approves the same.[46]x x x xCONCHITA M. DELA CRUZ testified that she is the Treasurer of DEB Auto Repair Shop and Parts Supply Corporation. DEB was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 22, 2001 and is in the business of supplying spare parts, repair and maintenance of light vehicles with the DPWH since 2001. She was the owner of DEB before its registration with the SEC. It was a sole proprietorship then. DEB Corporation started doing business with DPWH when invited to submit prices regarding the repair and maintenance of light vehicles, particularly Toyota, Mitsubishi, Isuzu, Ford and Nissan. They submitted a quotation and canvass by giving prices on the parts required by the DPWH. Their liaison officer fills up, signs and submits the canvass forms to the DPWH. Thereafter, they would wait for the evaluation of award as to which vehicles will be assigned to them as the lowest bidder. She does not know who evaluates the canvass forms and determines the lowest bid because DEB's liaison officer is the one who goes to DPWH to attend the evaluation of the prices. A notice is given by the DPWH to the liaison officer when the project is awarded to them. It is their liaison officer who oversees their transactions with DPWH. She has no knowledge that the cash invoice that was being used by their liaison officer in transacting with DPWH was the cash invoice where her name was indicated as proprietress.[47]Ruling of the SandiganbayanOn November 10, 2016, the Sandiganbayan promulgated its Decision finding petitioners Borje and Dela Cruz among those guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa through Falsification of Documents and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. The Sandiganbayan found the alleged emergency repairs on the 39 DPWH vehicles during the period March 2001 to December 2001 and subsequent thereto, covering 274 transactions that were the subject of the reimbursements claimed and paid to accused Martinez in the total sum of P5,166,539.00, to be fictitious and non-existent.[48]The Sandiganbayan held that with the repeated participation of petitioners and their co-accused in falsifying the documents relating to the transactions, it was clear that they conspired with one another in deceiving the DPWH into paying the claims for the fictitious emergency repairs and/or purchases of spare parts, thereby causing damage to the government in the total amount of P5,166,539.00.[49]The dispositive portion of the Decision reads, as follows:WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, as follows:1) In Criminal Case No. 28100, the Court finds accused Florendo Arias y Buñag, Maximo Borje y Aquino, Rolando Castillo y Comia, Burt Favorito y Barba, Erdito Quarto y Quiaot, Felipe A. San Jose and Conchita M. dela Cruz guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa through Falsification of Documents, defined and penalized under Article 315, in relation to Article 171 and Article 48, \n",

      "Personal notice to the heirs whose places of residence are known is mandatory. Trial courts cannot simply abdicate their duty under Section 4, Rule 76 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Court by indiscriminately applying the rule on publication. To do so would render nugatory the procedure laid down in Sec. 4 and the purpose for which it was intended.This is an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to reverse and set aside the twin orders of the Regional Trial Court, Palawan and Puerto Princesa City, Branch 51 (RTC), issued on August 16, 2017[1] and November 20, 2017[2] in SPL. PROC. No. 2391. The August 16, 2017 Order declared petitioners in default while the November 20, 2017 Order denied their Motion to Lift Order of General Default.AntecedentsOn March 28, 2017, Maria Lolita A. Echague (respondent) filed before the RTC a Petition[3] for the allowance of the will of the late Amparo Ferido Racca (Amparo) and issuance of letters testamentary in her favor. Respondent averred in the petition that Amparo executed a notarial will before her death on September 9, 2015 and bequeathed an undivided portion of a parcel of land consisting one-fourth (1/4) of her estate, or 412.5 square meters, in favor of her grandnephew Migdon Chris Laurence Ferido. Respondent also named herein petitioners Migdonio Racca (Migdonio) and Miam Grace Dianne Ferido Racca (Miam), Amparo's husband and daughter, respectively, as Amparo's known heirs.[4]Finding the petition sufficient in form and substance, the RTC issued an Order on April 18, 2017 setting the case for hearing on June 21 , 2017 at 8:30 a.m. On even date, the trial court issued the corresponding Notice of Hearing.[5]The hearing proceeded on June 21, 2017 but herein petitioners failed to appear, thus prompting the trial court to declare them in default.[6]On July 11, 2017, petitioners filed a Motion to Lift Order of General Default[7] on the ground of excusable negligence. They alleged that Migdonio received a copy of the Notice of Hearing only on June 19, 2017 or two (2) days prior to the scheduled hearing. Since Migdonio is already of advanced age, being 78 years old, and not in perfect health, he could not immediately act on the notice within such a short period of time. Miam, on the other hand, did not receive any notice. Due to their ignorance of procedural rules and financial constraints, petitioners were not immediately able to secure a counsel to represent their interest. Petitioners also manifested in the motion that Amparo was mentally incapable to make a will based on the medical certificate issued by her attending physician.[8]In its August 16, 2017 Order, the RTC denied petitioners' motion. It held that the jurisdictional requirements of publication and posting of notices had been substantially complied with.[9]Petitioners filed their Motion for Reconsideration[10] but the RTC denied the same in its November 20, 2017 Order.[11] Aggrieved, petitioners filed the present petition before the Court.IssuesPetitioners attribute the following errors on the part of the RTC:ITHE HONORABLE COURT ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT PUBLICATION AND POSTING BAR THE PARTICIPATION OF (SIC) HEREIN PETITIONERS;IITHE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE HEREIN COMPULSORY HEIR[S] WITH THE RIGHT TO OPPOSE THE PROBATE OF THE WILL.[12]Petitioners argue that being compulsory heirs, they have an interest in the probate of the will; that there are clear grounds to question the will, such as the subject of the devise being a conjugal property, as well as the mental condition of the deceased prior to her death;[13] that posting of the notice and its publication does not bar the lifting of the order of general default; that the order of general default may be lifted after a good and reasonable cause is shown;[14] that the order of general default should be lifted because their failure to appear during the jurisdictional hearing is due to excusable negligence; and that substantial justice requires the relaxation of the rules in their favor.[15]In her August 12, 2018 Comment,[16] respondent contended that the petition should be expunged and dismissed on the basis of procedural grounds; that the Verification and Certification on Non-Forum Shopping failed to refer to the issues in the instant petition or the issues in the probate proceedings before the RTC because it merely stated that \"[w]e further certify that we have not commenced and/or am not aware of any other action or proceeding involving the same land, or a portion thereof, or involving the same issue in any court, tribunal, or quasi-judicial agency;\"[17] that petitioners' Explanation only mentioned service of the petition to the adverse party through registered mail;[18] that the petition raises mixed questions of fact and law which should have been filed with the CA under the principle of hierarchy of courts;[19] and since an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 is discretionary upon the Court, petitioners failed to cite sufficient reasons why the Court should exercise such discretion.[20]On the substantive aspects of the petition, respondent maintained that the RTC's declaration of general default on June 21, 2017 was in accordance with law and jurisprudence. The Notice of Hearing had been published for three (3) consecutive weeks from May 6 to May 26, 2017 in Palawan Times, a newspaper of general circulation in Puerto Princesa City and the Province of Palawan. Respondent further argued that publication is a jurisdictional requirement while notice upon the heirs is a matter of procedural convenience, not a jurisdictional requisite.[21]Respondent also asserted that Amparo's will clearly states that the property being bequeathed to the devisee shall be taken from the free portion of her estate which she can freely dispose of by will.[22] She likewise alleged that Miam's status as a compulsory heir is questionable because her birth was registered after Amparo's death or almost thirty-four (34) years from Miam's alleged date of birth.[23]In their Reply,[24] petitioners countered that there is no controversy involving the nature of their relationship with Amparo, considering that respondent even recognized them as heirs.[25] As regards their Verification and Certification on Non-Forum Shopping, the same covers issues in the instant petition and before the probate court.[26] They asserted that the ruling in Alaban v. Court of Appeals[27] that personal notice upon the heirs is a matter of procedural convenience and not a jurisdictional requisite is not applicable because the lack of notice therein was cured by publication. Further, the parties in said case were not deprived of their substantial rights because they were allowed to participate in the proceedings.[28]At bottom, the issues for resolution by the Court are: (a) may the Order of General Default issued by the RTC against the petitioners be set aside? and (b) are known heirs of the testator still entitled to personal notice despite the publication and posting of the notice of the hearing?The Court's RulingThe petition is meritorious. Petitioners were not properly notified in accordance with Sec. 4, Rule 76 of the Revised Rules of Court.  A petition for review under Rule 45 raising a pure question of law is the appropriate remedy Petitioners brought the instant appeal under Rule 45 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, Sec. 1 of which provides that the subject of the appeal shall be a judgment, final order or resolution of the RTC, among others.[29] A final order is defined as one which disposes of the subject matter in its entirety or terminates a particular proceeding or action, leaving nothing else to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined by the court.[30]The twin orders being assailed herein pertain to the June 21, 2017 Order of general default issued by the RTC. An order of general default, as explained in Heirs of Eugenio Lopez, Sr. v. Hon. Enriquez,[31] has the following effects on the party declared in default:x x x A party declared in default loses his standing in court. As a result of his loss of standing, a party in default cannot appear in court, adduce evidence, be heard, or be entitled to notice. A party in default cannot even appeal from the judgment rendered by the court, unless he flies a motion to set aside the order of default under the grounds provided in what is now Sec. 3, Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.[32]By virtue of the assailed orders of the RTC, herein petitioners, who claim to be the husband and the daughter of Amparo, had been barred from participating in the allowance of her alleged last will and testament. Their non-­participation in the probate proceeding would prevent them from raising matters that may cast serious doubts on the genuineness and authenticity of Amparo's will. By reason of the default order, they cannot participate in the proceedings, oppose the probate of the will which they believe to be unauthentic, or even appeal the judgment of the trial court thereon. As such, the August 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017 Orders of the trial court are final and, therefore, proper subjects of an appeal under Rule 45.Significantly, the present petition is concerned with whether petitioners, being know n heirs of the testator, are still entitled to notice under Sec. 4 of Rule 76 despite the publication of the notice of hearing. This issue indubitably involves a question of law which the Court may entertain in a petition filed under Rule 45.[33]  An Order of General Default does not apply in probate proceedings The crux of petitioners' appeal pertains to the issuance of the order of general default by the trial court in the probate of Amparo's will. Apparently, the RTC based the issuance of such order on Sec. 3, Rule 9 of the Rules of Civil Procedure which provides:RULE 9Effect of Failure to PleadSection 3. Default; declaration of. - If the defending party rails to answer within the time allowed there for, the court shall, upon motion of the claiming party with notice to the defending party, and proof of such failure, declare the defending party in default. Thereupon, the court shall proceed to render judgment granting the claimant such relief as his pleading may warrant, unless the court in its discretion requires the claimant to submit evidence. Such reception of evidence may be delegated to the clerk of court.However, Sec. 3, Rule 9 does not apply in probate proceedings. A careful reading of Sec. 3 reveals that an order of default avails only in litigious proceedings. Thus, it cannot be validly issued in a special proceeding such as the probate of a will. The Court already made this clarification in the early case of Riera v. Palmaroli[34] as follows:Now what is the meaning of \"judgment rendered upon default.\" as used in section 513? The reference is of course to the default mentioned in section 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure. x x x A default, such as is there intended, can only arise in contentious litigation where a party who has been impleaded as a defendant and served with process fails to appear at the time required in the summons or to answer at the time provided by the rules of the court. The proceeding to probate a will is not a contentious litigation in any sense, because nobody is impleaded observed with process. It is a special proceeding, and although notice of the application is published, nobody is bound to appeal and no order for judgment by default, is ever entered. If the application is not opposed, the court may allow the will on the testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses only (sec. 631, Code Civ. Proc.), provided none of the reasons specified in section 634 of the Code of Civil Procedure for disallowing the will are found to exist. If any interested person opposes the probate, the court hears the testimony and allows or disallows the will accordingly. From such judgment any interested person may appeal to the Supreme Court within twenty days. (Sec. 781, Code Civ. Proc.) Though the action taken by a Court of First Instance in thus allowing or disallowing a will is properly denominated a judgment, it is not a judgment rendered upon default even though no person appears to oppose the probate.[35] (emphases supplied)It should be emphasized that in probate proceedings, the court's area of inquiry is limited to an examination and resolution of the extrinsic validity of the will.[36] By extrinsic validity, the testamentary capacity and the compliance with the formal requisites or solemnities prescribed by law are the only questions presented for the resolution of the court.[37] Due execution of the will or its extrinsic validity pertains to whether the testator, being of sound mind, freely executed the will in accordance with the formalities prescribed by Articles 805 and 806 of the New Civil Code.[38] These matters do not necessitate the issuance of an order of default against parties who failed to appear in the proceedings despite the publication of the notice of hearing. After all, the probate of a will is mandatory[39] and cannot be left to the discretion of the persons interested in the estate of the deceased.Moreover, Rule 76 does not expressly provide for the issuance of a default order in the absence of persons contesting the will. In the event that no persons appear to contest the will, Sec. 5[40] thereof only directs the court to grant allowance of the will based on the testimony of a witness that it was executed pursuant to law, or in the case of holographic will, that the handwriting and signature were those of the testator.Without legal support, the RTC cannot validly issue an order of default in probate proceedings. Hence, the RTC palpably erred in issuing the order of general default due to the non-appearance of petitioners in the June 21, 2017 hearing.  Notice to the designated and known heirs, devisees and legatees under Section 4, Rule 76 of the Rules of Court is mandatory; Publication of notice of hearing is not sufficient when the places of residence of the heirs, legatees and devisees are known The notice requirement in the allowance or disallowance of a will is found in Secs. 3 and 4, Rule 76 of the 1997 Rules of Court, which read:Rule 76Allowance or Disallowance of WillSection 3. Court to appoint time for proving will. Notice thereof to be published. - When a will is delivered to, or a petition for the allowance or a will is filed in, the court having jurisdiction, such court shall fix a time and place for proving the will when all concerned may appear to contest the allowance thereof, and shall cause notice of such time and place to be published three (3) weeks successively, previous to the time appointed, in a newspaper of general circulation in the province.But no newspaper publication shall be made where the petition for probate has been filed by the testator himself.Section 4. Heirs, devisees, legatees, and executors to be notified by mail or personally. - The court shall also cause copies of the notice of the time and place fixed for proving the will to be addressed to the designated or other known heirs, legatees, and devisees of the testator resident in the Philippines at their places or residence, and deposited in the post office with the postage thereon prepaid at least twenty (20) days before the hearing, if such places of residence be known. A copy of the notice must in like manner be mailed to the person named as executor, if he be not the petitioner; also, to any person named as co-executor not petitioning, if their places of residence be known. Personal service of copies of the notice at [least] (10) days before the day of hearing shall be equivalent to mailing.If the testator asks for the allowance of his own will notice shall be sent only to his compulsory heirs.Notable that Secs. 3 and 4 prescribe two (2) modes of notification of the hearing: (1) by publication in a newspaper of general circulation or the Official Gazette, and (2) by personal notice to the designated or known heirs, legatees and devisees. Under Sec. 3, publication of the notice of hearing shall be done upon the delivery of the will, or filing of the petition for allowance of the will in the court having jurisdiction. On the other hand, personal notice under Sec. 4 shall be served to the designated or known heirs, legatees and devisees, and the executor or co-executor, at their residence, if such are known.In here, the RTC declared petitioners to have defaulted. The RTC held the view that the publication of the notice of hearing in a newspaper of general circulation, pursuant to Sec. 3 of Rule 76, sufficiently notified petitioners of the scheduled hearing.Once again, the RTC is mistaken.We shall expoun\n",

      "Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari[1] are the Decision[2] dated September 13, 2018 and the Resolulion[3] dated February 13, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 105722, which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated July 8, 2015 and the Resolution[5] dated September 3, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court of Aparri, Cagayan, Branch 8 (RTC), and accordingly declared, inter alia, that the sale of Lot No. 1559 to petitioners Spouses Benny and Normita Rol (petitioners) is valid only insofar as half of the aggregate undivided interest of Fausto Urdas, Sr. (Fausto), Chita Urdas (Chita), and Maria Urdas Baclig (Maria) therein are concerned.The FactsRespondent Isabel Urdas Racho (Isabel) alleged that her brother, Loreto Urdas (Loreto), was the registered owner of a 1,249-square meter (sq. m.) parcel of land located in the Municipality of Gonzaga, Cagayan, denominated as Lot No. 1559, as reflected in Original Certificate of Title No. O-1061.[6] On August 6, 1963, Loreto died without an issue, thus, leaving his siblings, namely, Fausto, Chita, Maria, and Isabel as his intestate heirs to the said lot. Sometime before the filing of the complaint, Isabel discovered that: (a) Lot No. 1559 was subdivided into equal 624.50-sq. m. portions, denominated as Lot Nos. 1559-A and 1559-B; (h) despite Loreto's death in 1963, petitioners made it appear that Loreto sold to them the subdivided lots through a Deed of Absolute Sale of Portion of Registered Land[7] dated September 1, 2006 and Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land[8] dated June 19, 2012, respectively; and (c) in light of the execution of said deeds, new titles covering the subdivided lots, namely, Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. T-156992[9] and 032-2012004566[10] were issued in petitioners' names. As such, Isabel was constrained to file a complaint[11] for reivindicacion and damages before the RTC against, inter alia, petitioners.[12]In their Answer with Counterclaim,[13] petitioners asserted that sometime in 1993, they were looking to purchase a parcel of land. Coincidentally, petitioners were able to meet Fausto's wife and son, namely, Leoncia,[14] and Allan, who offered to sell them one-half of Lot No. 1559 for P25,000.00, to which they agreed. Thus, on September 13, 1993 Fausto, Chita, Maria, and Allan executed an Extra-Judicial Settlement with Sale[15] (EJSS) concerning the subject lot whereby: (a) the subject lot was subdivided equally into two (2) 624.50-sq. m. portions, denominated as Lot Nos. 1559-A and 1559-B; (b) Lot No. 1559-A was adjudicated to Fausto, Chita, and Maria, who then sold the same to petitioners for the aforementioned amount; and (c) Lot No. 1559-B was adjudicated to Allan. Thereafter, petitioners built a house on Lot No. 1559-A and occupied the same peacefully. In 2010, petitioners purchased from Allan and Leoncia Lot No. 1559-B, for which they executed a Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land[16] dated September 26, 2011. According to petitioners, they have been in open, continuous, and peaceful possession of Lot No. 1559-A since 1993 and Lot No. 1559-B since 2010, until Isabel disturbed the same by filing the instant complaint in June 2013.[17]The RTC RulingIn a.Decision[18] dated July 8, 2015, the RTC ruled in Isabel's favor, and accordingly, declared null and void the following: (a) the EJSS dated September 13, 1993; (b) the Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land dated September 26, 2011; (c) the Deed of Absolute Sale of Portion of Registered Land dated September 1, 2006; and (d) the Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land dated June 19, 2012. The RTC also ordered petitioners to reconvey to Isabel the total area of 312.25-sq. m. from Lot No. 1559, and to pay her P5,646.00 as actual damages, P30,000.00 as attorney's fees, and the costs of suit.[19]The RTC found the Deeds of Sale dated September 1, 2006 and June 19, 2012 void for being forgeries, pointing out that there was no way Loreto could have signed those instruments as he died in 1963. It also declared void the EJSS as it was executed without the knowledge and consent of one of Loreto's intestate heirs, i.e., Isabel, and consequently, the Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land dated September 26, 2011 for being a subsequent transfer that emanated from the EJSS. Nonetheless, the RTC found petitioners to be purchasers in good faith, opining that they acquired Lot No. 1559 for valuable consideration, not knowing beforehand that their title thereto was a product of fraud. As such, they are only required to reconvey to Isabel an area of 312.25-sq. m. out of the total area of 1,249-sq. m. of Lot No. 1559, in order to satisfy the latter's share in Loreto's intestate estate.[20]Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution[21] dated September 3, 2015. Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the CA.The CA Rulingln a Decision[22] dated September 13, 2018, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling with modifications, in that: (a) the sale by Fausto, Chita, and Maria to petitioners are valid and binding but only insofar as their respective undivided interests in the half of Lot No. 1559 is concerned; and (b) the award of actual damages to Isabel was deleted.[23]Echoing the RTC, the CA declared void the EJSS, considering that, inter alia, Isabel, a legal heir to Loreto's intestate estate, was excluded therefrom. As such, the CA rendered void the adjudication of Lot No. 1559-B to Allan as he is not a legal heir to Loreto's intestate estate; and consequently, Allan's transfer of the same to petitioners through the Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land dated September 26, 2011 is likewise void, pursuant to the maxim nemo dat quod non habet. Nonetheless, the CA deemed valid the sale of Lot No. 1559-A to petitioners, but only insofar as Fausto, Chita, and Maria's respective aliquot shares therein, i.e., a total area of 468.375-sq. m., are concerned. Relatedly, the CA ruled that petitioners are buyers in bad faith due to their failure to further inquire as to the capacity of Allan and Leoncia to sell Lot No. 1559 and investigate the whereabouts of Loreto, the registered owner thereof.[24]Further, the CA held that Isabel is not guilty of laches because she was deprived of her hereditary share without her knowledge and consent; and as such, she is not barred from invoking her right to her inheritance in Loreto's estate.[25]Finally, the CA deleted the award of actual damages in Isabel's favor for her failure to show her entitlement thereto; but upheld the award of attorney's fees and costs of suit in her favor as she was forced to litigate in order to assert her rights over Lot No. 1559.[26]Undaunted, petitioners moved for reconsideration but the same was denied in a Resolution[27] dated February 13, 2019; hence, the instant petition.The Issue Before the CourtThe core issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly ruled that the conveyance of Lot No. 1559 to petitioners is null and void, except as to the portion in Lot No. 1559-A pertaining to Fausto, Chita, and Maria which is deemed valid.The Court's RulingThe petition is without merit.Records show that there are a total of four (4) documents which supposedly transferred the two (2) subdivided portions of Lot No. 1559, namely, Lot Nos. 1559-A and 1559-B, to petitioners. On the one hand, Isabel alleged that the documents were the Deed of Absolute Sale of Portion of Registered Land dated September 1, 2006 covering Lot No. 1559-A and the Deed of Sale of a Portion of Land dated June 19, 2012 covering Lot No. 1559- B, both purportedly executed by Loreto in favor of petitioners. On the other hand, petitioners anchor their claim of ownership on: (a) the EJSS dated September 13, 1993 executed by Fausto, Chita, Maria, and Allan - which adjudicated a half portion of Lot No. 1559, i.e., Lot No. 1559-A, to Fausto, Chita, and Maria who thereafter sold it to petitioners, and adjudicated the other half, i.e., Lot No. 1559-B to Allan; and (b) the Deed of Sale of a Port1on of Land dated September 26, 2011 executed by Allan in favor of petitioners.As for the documents pointed out by Isabel, suffice it to say that they are null and void for being forgeries, as it is simply impossible that Loreto, who died in 1963, could have executed said documents in 2006 and 2012, respectively. It is settled that forged deeds of sale are null and void and convey no title.[28]As for the EJSS dated September 13, 1993, the CA correctly declared the same to be null and void, considering that it was executed without the knowledge and consent of Isabel, a co-heir of Fausto, Chita, and Maria, to the estate of their deceased brother, Loreto.[29] In a catena of cases, the Court had consistently ruled that a deed of extrajudicial partition executed to the total exclusion of any of the legal heirs, who had no knowledge of and consent to the execution of the same, is fraudulent, vicious, and a total nullity,[30] as in this case. As such, it produced no effect whatsoever either against or in favor of anyone.[31] Therefore, the contents of the EJSS, namely: (a) the subdivision of Lot No. 1559 to two (2) equal halves, namely Lot Nos. 1559-A and 1559-B and (b) alienation of the aforementioned halves, first, to petitioners with consideration and second, to Allan gratuitously, are null and void and cannot be given any legal effect as well.At this juncture, it is well to reiterate that the subdivision of Lot No. 1559 into two (2) equal halves, i.e., Lot Nos. 1559-A and 1 559-B, as well as the attempted conveyance of these definite portions to petitioners and Allan, resulted from the execution of the EJSS - which again, was without the knowledge and consent of Isabel. In Cabrera v. Ysaac,[32] the Court held that a sale of a definite portion of a co-owned property requires the consent of all the co-owners. Without such unanimous consent, a co-owner can only convey his undivided, aliquot interest over a co-owned property; he/she has no right to divide, and thereafter, convey definite portions thereof, viz.:If the alienation precedes the partition, the co-owner cannot sell a definite portion of the land without consent from his or her co-owners. He or she could only sell the undivided interest of the co-owned property. As summarized in Lopez v. Illustre, \"[i]f he is the owner of an undivided half of a tract of land, he has a right to sell and convey an undivided half, but he has no right to divide the lot into two parts, and convey the whole of one part by metes and bounds.\"The undivided interest of a co-owner is also referred to as the \"ideal or abstract quota\" or \"proportionate share.\" On the other hand, the definite portion of the land refers to specific metes and bounds of a co-owned property.To illustrate, if a ten-hectare property is owned equally by ten co­-owners, the undivided interest of a co-owner is one hectare. The definite portion of that interest is usually determined during judicial or extrajudicial partition. After partition, a definite portion of the property held in common is allocated to a specific co-owner. The co-ownership is dissolved and, in effect, each of the former co-owners is free to exercise autonomously the rights attached to his or her ownership over the definite portion of the land. It is crucial that the co-owners agree to which portion of the land goes to whom.Hence, prior to partition, a sale of a definite portion of common property requires the consent of all co-owners because it operates to partition the land with respect to the co-owner selling his or her share. The co-owner or seller is already marking which portion should redound to his or her autonomous ownership upon future partition.x x x xThe rules allow respondent to sell his undivided interest in the co-­ownership. However, this was not the object of the sale between him and petitioner. The object of the sale was a definite portion. Even if it was respondent who was benefiting from the fruits of the lease contract to petitioner, respondent has \"no right to sell or alienate a concrete, specific or determinate part of the thing owned in common, because his right over the thing is represented by quota or ideal portion without any physical adjudication.\"[33] (Emphases and underscoring supplied)In this case, when Loreto died, his siblings, namely, Fausto, Chitn, Maria, and Isabel all became co-owners of Loreto's intestate estate, i.e., Lot No. 1559, pursuant to Article 1078[34] of the Civil Code, with all of them having equal interest therein, i.e., 1/4 of the property. Thus, for the alienation of definite portions of Lot No. 1559 to be valid, it must be with the consent of all of them. However, the alienations of definite portions made in the EJSS was without the knowledge and consent of Isabel, and hence, are null and void.Nonetheless, as co-owners of Lot No. 1559, Fausto, Chita, Maria, and Isabel are free to dispose of their undivided aliquot shares therein, which shall be limited to the portion that may be allotted to them upon partition.[35] Otherwise stated, before an actual partition of an estate, an heir can only alienate his successional rights or undivided interest thereto, and not specific portions thereof.[36]Thus, Fausto, Chita, and Maria could not sell a definite portion of an undivided property, i.e., one half of Lot No. 1559 (which formerly pertained to Lot No. 1559-A), to petitioners. However, the Court nevertheless recognizes their intent to sell one-half (1/2) of their inchoate interest over Lot No. 1559 to the latter - not through the EJSS but via an oral contract of sale as in fact, they were able to do so as they received proper compensation therefor from petitioners.[37] Thus, petitioners were able to validly acquire one­ half(1/2) of Fausto, Chita, and Maria's aggregate three-fourths (3/4) interest, or a total of 3/8 interest, over Lot No. 1559.In the same vein, Fausto, Chita, and Maria could also not gratuitously convey a definite portion of the same undivided property, i.e., one half of Lot No. 1559 (which formerly pertained to Lot No. 1559-8) to Allan. In contrast, however, to petitioner's case, the Court could not give life to the three (3) siblings' intent to convey one-half (1/2) of their inchoate interest over Lot No. 1559 to Allan, absent compliance with the requirements of the law. To reiterate, the foregoing conveyance to Allan was made gratuitously, and hence, essentially partakes of a donation of a real property. As such, it is required, inter alia, that the donation must be made in a public instrument, and that the acceptance is made either in the same deed or in a separate instrument.[38] Since the only document of record showing compliance with the foregoing requirements is the EJSS - which is, as discussed, null and void - Fausto, Chita, and Maria's donation over such portion to Allan is void as well. Consequently, Allan and Leoncia's sale of the same portion of land to petitioners had no legal effect whatsoever, following the maxim nemo dat quod non habet.[39] Hence, Fausto, Chita, and Maria are deemed to have retained their remaining inchoate interest, i.e., 1/8 each, over Lot No. 1559.Finally, since Isabel had no knowledge of, and thus, did not give her consent to, the foregoing, she retains her 1/4 inchoate interest over Lot No. 1559.On a related matter, petitioners cannot claim to be innocent purchasers for value. According to jurisprudence, \"An innocent purchaser for value refers to someone who 'buys the property of another without notice that some other person has a right to or interest in it, and who pays a full and fair price at the time of the purchase or before receiving any notice of another person's claim.'\"[40] Here, the CA correctly pointed out that petitioners should have already been put on guard as to the true ownership of the property when they learned that it was registered in the name of another person with whom they were not dealing. Their failure to question the authority of the sellers thus negated their claim that they were innocent purchasers for value.Furthermore, petitioners' contention that Isabel is guilty of laches is unavailing. \"Laches is defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.\"[41] In this case, petitioners' self-serving allegation that Isabel knew of the sale of Lot Nos. 1559-A and 1559-B to them for more than twenty (20) years was not substantiated by evidence on record. Absent any clear and convincing proof, Isabel's claim cann\n",

      " Petitioner Manila Electric Company (Meralco) filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] to assail the Court of Appeal's January 31, 2011 Decision[2] in CA-G.R. CV No. 80558, which set aside the December 19, 2003 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City, Branch 67.In its assailed judgment, the CA ordered Meralco to pay a franchise tax on the operation of public utilities pursuant to Section 25 of Municipal Ordinance No. 93-35 (MO 93-35) or the Revenue Code of the Municipality of Muntinlupa, reckoned from the effectivity of Republic Act No. 7926 (RA 7926),[4] also known as the Charter of the City of Muntinlupa on March 1, 1995.The Antecedents:Meralco is a public utility corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws. Pursuant to RA 9209,[5] the statute granting its franchise, Meralco is enfranchised to construct, operate and maintain a distribution system for the conveyance of electricity in the cities and municipalities in the National Capital Region, among others.On the flip side, the City of Muntinlupa is a local government unit that has been converted from a municipality into a highly urbanized city by virtue of RA 7926. Respondent Nelia A. Barlis (Barlis) was the City Treasurer of Muntinlupa at the time Meralco was assessed to pay a franchise tax.On January 1, 1994, MO 93-35 or the Revenue Code of the Municipality of Muntinlupa took effect.[6] Section 25[7] thereof imposed a franchise tax on private persons or corporations operating public utilities within its territorial jurisdiction at the rate of 50% of 1% of the gross annual receipts of the preceding calendar year.Subsequently, RA 7926 was enacted and approved on March 1, 1995 which converted the Municipality of Muntinlupa into a highly urbanized city, now the City of Muntinlupa. Section 56 of the transitory and final provisions of RA 7926 adopted all existing municipal ordinances of the Municipality of Muntinlupa as of March 1, 1995, and shall all continue to take effect within Muntinlupa as of March 1, 1995, and shall all continue to take effect within the City of Muntinlupa unless its sangguniang panglungsod enacts an ordinance providing otherwise.On June 28, 1999, Barlis sent a letter to Meralco demanding payment of the franchise tax it owed to Muntinlupa City from 1992 to 1999 pursuant to Section 25 of MO 93-35 and paragraph 7 of the Bureau of Local Government Finance Circular No. 20-98. Barlis likewise requested for Meralco's certified statement of gross sales/receipts for the years 1992 to 1999 that would support the computation of the franchise tax due.[8]On July 14, 1999, Meralco requested for the deferment of the submission of its statement of gross sales/receipts, and for a copy of MO 93-35.[9] It also mentioned that its representatives had amicably discussed the matter with Barlis on July 13, 1999, and that the May 5, 1999 Decision of this Court in Manila Electric Company v. Province of Laguna[10] is still pending reconsideration.[11]Meralco likewise ignored the August 21, 2001[12] and the September 27, 2001[13] demand letters for payment of the franchise tax for the years 1994 to 2000 on the premise that the City of Muntinlupa, then a municipality, did not have the power and authority to impose and collect a franchise tax. Pursuant to Section 142[14] in relation to Sections 134,[15] 137[16] and 151[17] of RA 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the power and authority to impose and collect a franchise tax lies with the provinces and cities.Meralco thus instituted a Petition With Prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction[18] before the RTC of Pasig City, Branch 67 to declare Section 25 of MO 93-35 as null and void for being contrary to law, unjust and confiscatory, and to enjoin the City of Muntinlupa from demanding the submission of its certified statement of gross sales/receipts for the computation of the franchise tax.In its Answer With Compulsory Counterclaim,[19] the City of Muntinlupa mainly argued that Section 137 of RA 7160 and Articles 227 and 237 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) allow the imposition of a franchise tax by a local government unit. It also averred that it is entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees in view of Meralco's filing of a baseless and malicious suit which tainted its reputation and constrained it to engage the services of a counsel.In its Reply and Answer to Compulsory Counterclaim,[20] Meralco maintained that municipalities are not endowed with the authority to impose a franchise tax, which power exclusively belongs to provinces and cities pursuant to RA 7160. It argued that the presumption of validity does not apply because Section 25 of MO 93-35 is patently discordant with existing law and jurisprudence, and that the passage of the Charter of Muntinlupa City cannot breathe life into an ordinance that was void from the beginning. It countered that the City is not entitled to damages because Meralco acted in good faith in seeking relief for a transgression of a right.The Pre-Trial Order[21] enumerated the issues for resolution as follows: (1) whether Muntinlupa City could legally collect a franchise tax from 1992 to 1999; (2) whether Muntinlupa City could legally require Meralco to submit certain documents for the determination of its franchise tax; (3) whether MO 93-35 as incorporated in the Charter of Muntinlupa City is a valid ordinance; (4) whether Muntinlupa City is entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees; and (5) whether Meralco is entitled to the issuance of a writ of preliminary and/or permanent injunction enjoining the City of Muntinlupa from collecting franchise tax.On January 30, 2003, Meralco and Muntinlupa City filed a Joint Motion for Summary Judgment.[22]Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:In a Decision[23] dated September 19, 2003, the trial court struck down MO 93-35, particularly Section 25 thereof, for being ultra vires because it was enacted when Muntinlupa was still a municipality which, as such, had no power to levy taxes, fees or charges already conferred to the provinces following Sections 142 and 137 of RA 7160. It held that an ordinance that is invalid on its face may be set aside for being inoperative, and that the 30-day period within which an ordinance can be assailed is merely permissive by express use of the word \"may\" in Section 187 of RA 7160.The trial court declared that Article 236 (b) of the IRR cannot contravene or go beyond Section 142 of RA 7160 which it seeks to implement. Also, Section 56 of the Charter of Muntinlupa City adopting Section 25 of MO 93-35 did not cure its infirmity. Thus, the trial court granted Meralco's prayer for the issuance of a writ of injunction enjoining Muntinlupa City from collecting the franchise tax.The fallo of the trial court's ruling states:WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:1. Declaring the implementation of Section 25 of Municipal Ordinance No. 93-35 otherwise known as the revenue code of the Municipality of Muntinlupa null and void ab initio for being ultra vires and contrary to law;2. Commanding the respondents and their agents, representatives, and successors to desist from enforcing or implementing the said Sections [sic] 25 of Municipal Ordinance No. 93-35[,] and Article 236 (b) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991, as well as from collecting any amount pursuant thereto;3. Enjoining and commanding the respondents, their agents, representatives, and successors to desist from demanding upon the petitioner to submit a certified statement of its gross sales/receipts derived from its business within the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Muntinlupa for the purpose of assessing franchise tax, and from demanding payment of franchise tax from the petitioner; and4. On the counterclaim, dismissing and denying respondents' claim for moral damages and attorney's fees for lack of merit.SO ORDERED.[24]Muntinlupa City elevated the case to the CA with the following assignment of errors:IWHETHER OR NOT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DECLARING AS NULL AND VOID FOR BEING ULTRA VIRES AND CONTRARY TO LAW SECTION 25 OF [MO] NO. 93-35.IIWHETHER OR NOT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DECLARING AS NULL AND VOID FOR BEING CONTRARY TO SECTION 142 OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE, ARTICLE 236 (B) OF [THE IRR].IIIWHETHER OR NOT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ENJOINING [APPELLANTS] FROM IMPOSING [AND] COLLECTING THE SUBJECT FRANCHISE TAX UPON [MERALCO], REQUIRING FOR THAT PURPOSE THE SUBMISSION OF ITS CERTIFIED STATEMENT OF GROSS SALES/RECEIPTS DERIVED WITHIN THE CITY.[25]Ruling of the Court of Appeals:In its January 31, 2011 Decision,[26] the appellate court concurred with the trial court that municipalities have no authority to levy and collect a franchise tax due to the ultra vires nature of Section 25 of MO 93-35. However, it declared that MO 93-35 was cured of its legal infirmities when the Municipality of Muntinlupa was converted into a highly urbanized city by virtue of its Charter in 1995. Moreover, it held that MO 93-35 is presumed to be valid since it had yet to be declared void by final judgment by any court at the time of its adoption. Section 56 of the Charter of Muntinlupa City effectively cured the defects and re-enacted Section 25 of MO 93-35, although the curative effect applies prospectively. Hence, the appellate court held that Meralco's obligation to pay franchise tax begins only from March 1, 1995, the date when the Charter of Muntinlupa City was enacted.The dispositive portion of the appellate court's assailed Decision reads:WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the Decision of the RTC of Pasig City, Branch 67, in Civil Case No. 68725, is SET ASIDE and a NEW ONE ENTERED as follows:1. Declaring Sec. 25 of Municipal Ordinance 93-35, otherwise known as the Revenue Code of the (now) City of Muntinlupa, as having taken effect only from the date of effectivity of RA 7926, otherwise known as the Charter of the City of Muntinlupa;2. Ordering appellee to comply with appellants' demands for a certified statement of its gross sales/receipts derived from its business within the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Muntinlupa, and other documents, for the purpose of assessing franchise tax, computed only from the date of RA 7926 took effect;3. Ordering appellee to pay franchise tax to appellants based on said assessment.SO ORDERED.[27]Aggrieved, Meralco filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari[28] raising the sole issue of:WHETHER SECTION 25 OF MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE NO. 93-35 OF THE THEN MUNICIPALITY OF MUNTINLUPA IMPOSING A FRANCHISE [TAX], WHICH WAS DECLARED NULL AND VOID AB INITIO FOR BEING ULTRA VIRES AND CONTRARY TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 BOTH BY THE TRIAL AND THE APPELLATE COURTS, WAS CURED BY SECTION 56 OF R.A. 7926 CONVERTING THE MUNICIPALITY OF MUNTINLUPA INTO A HIGHLY URBANIZED CITY.[29]Our RulingThe Petition is meritorious.Section 25 of MO 93-35 is null and void for being ultra vires.Ferrer, Jr. v. Bautista[30] enumerates the requirements for an ordinance to be valid, legally binding, and enforceable, to wit:For an ordinance to be valid though, it must not only be within the corporate powers of the LGU to enact and must be passed according to the procedure prescribed by law, it should also conform to the following requirements: (1) not contrary to the Constitution or any statute; (2) not unfair or oppressive; (3) not partial or discriminatory; (4) not prohibit but may regulate trade; (5) general and consistent with public policy; and (6) not unreasonable.[31]Legaspi v. City of Cebu[32] explains the two tests in determining the validity of an ordinance, i.e., the Formal Test and the Substantive Test.[33] The Formal Test requires the determination of whether the ordinance was enacted within the corporate powers of the LGU, and whether the same was passed pursuant to the procedure laid down by law. Meanwhile, the Substantive Test primarily assesses the reasonableness and fairness of the ordinance and significantly its compliance with the Constitution and existing statutes.As correctly ruled by the RTC and the CA, MO 93-35, particularly Section 25 thereof, has failed to meet the requirements of a valid ordinance. Applying the Formal Test, the passage of the subject ordinance was beyond the corporate powers of the then Municipality of Muntinlupa, hence, ultra vires.Based on the Substantive Test, Section 25 of MO 93-35 deviated from the express provision of RA 7160. While ordinances, just like other laws and statutes, enjoy the presumption of validity, they may be struck down and set aside when their invalidity or unreasonableness is evident on the face or has been established in evidence.[34] In this case, Section 25 of MO 93-35 was evidently passed beyond the powers of a municipality in clear contravention of RA 7160.MO 93-35 was passed by the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Muntinlupa and took effect on January 1, 1994. This is plainly ultra vires considering the clear and categorical provisions of Section 142 in relation to Sections 134, 137 and 151 of RA 7160 vesting to the provinces and cities the power to impose, levy, and collect a franchise tax. Muntinlupa being then a municipality definitely had no power or authority to enact the subject franchise tax ordinance.For emphasis, we reproduce below Sections 142, 134, 137 and 151 of RA 7160: ARTICLE IIMunicipalitiesSECTION 142. Scope of Taxing Powers. - Except as otherwise provided in this Code, municipalities may levy taxes, fees, and charges not otherwise levied by provinces.ARTICLE IProvincesSECTION 134. Scope of Taxing Powers. - Except as otherwise provided in this Code, the province may levy only the taxes, fees, and charges as provided in this Article.x x x xSECTION 137. Franchise Tax. - Notwithstanding any exemption granted by any law or other special law, the province may impose a tax on businesses enjoying a franchise, at a rate not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of one percent (1%) of the gross annual receipts for the preceding calendar year based on the incoming receipt, or realized, within its territorial jurisdiction.In the case of a newly started business, the tax shall not exceed one-twentieth (1/20) of one percent (1%) of the capital investment. In the succeeding calendar year, regardless of when the business started to operate, the tax shall be based on the gross receipts for the preceding calendar year, or any fraction thereon, as provided herein.ARTICLE IIICitiesSECTION 151. Scope of Taxing Powers. - Except as otherwise provided in this Code, the city, may levy the taxes, fees, and charges which the province or municipality may impose: Provided, however, That the taxes, fees and charges levied and collected by highly urbanized and independent component cities shall accrue to them and distributed in accordance with the provisions of this Code.The rates of taxes that the city may levy may exceed the maximum rates allowed for the province or municipality by not more than fifty percent (50%) except the rates of professional and amusement taxes.The foregoing provisions clearly set out that municipalities may only levy taxes not otherwise levied by the provinces. Section 137 particularly provides that provinces may impose a franchise tax on businesses granted with a franchise to operate. Since provinces have been vested with the power to levy a franchise tax, it follows that municipalities, pursuant to Section 142 of RA 7160, could no longer levy it. Therefore, Section 25 of MO 93-35 which was enacted when Muntinlupa was still a municipality and which imposed a franchise tax on public utility corporations within its territorial jurisdiction, is ultra vires for being violative of Section 142 of RA 7160.The City cannot seek refuge under Article 236(b)[35] of Administrative Order No. 270[36] (AO 270) in its bid to declare Section 25 of MO 93-35 as valid. As mere rules and regulations implementing RA 7160, they cannot go beyond the intent of the law that it seeks to implement. The spring cannot rise above its source.Hence, even if Article 236(b) of AO 270 appears to vest municipalities with such taxing power, Section 142 of RA 7160 which disenfranchised municipalities from levying a franchise tax, should prevail. The power to levy a franchise tax is bestowed only to provinces and cities.In sum, the then Municipality of Muntinlupa acted without authority in passing Section 25 of MO 93-35, hence it is null and void for being ultra vires.[37]  Section 56 of the Charter of Muntinlupa City has no curative effect on Section 25 of MO 93-35, the latter being null and void.  The case of City of Pasig v. Manila Electric Company (City of Pasig)[38] is relevant in resolving the i\n",

      " This petition for certiorari filed under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeks to set aside the Decision[1] and Resolution[2] of the Commission on Audit (COA) issued on December 28, 2017 and January 29, 2020, respectively. In both issuances, the COA dismissed the appeal filed by petitioners for being filed out of time.AntecedentsThe present controversy stemmed from the issuance of Resolution No. 53[3] and Resolution No. 55[4] by the Sangguniang Bayan of Mondragon, Northern Samar on December 10, 2012. Resolution No. 53 authorizes the grant of Economic Crisis Assistance (ECA) allowance while Resolution No. 55 grants the Monetary Augmentation of Municipal Agency (MAMA) allowance to the municipal employees of Mondragon. The Sangguniang Bayan of Mondragon also passed on even date, Ordinance No. 07, Series of 2012[5] to appropriate the amounts of P4,762,788.62 and P644,000.00 from the savings/unexpended allotment and unappropriated balances of the municipality to fund the ECA and the MAMA, respectively.On February 20, 2014, the Audit Team Leader of the Team 2, Audit Group F-Northern Samar Province issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 14-001-101 (2012)[6] for the amount of P733,869.00 and ND No. 14-002-101 (2012)[7] for the amount of P1,513,470.54 representing the ECA granted to the officials and employees for being contrary to Section 12 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6758 and Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002. A third notice of disallowance, ND No. 14-003-101 (2012),[8] was also issued on the same date for the amount of P618,800.00 supposedly expended for the MAMA in violation of Sec. 12 of R.A. No. 6758.Petitioners Ismael C. Bugna, Jr. (Mayor), Beverly C. Mananguite (Municipal Accountant), Carissa D. Galing (Municipal Treasurer) and Josefina O. Pelo (Municipal Budget Officer) (collectively, petitioners) filed their Appeal[9] to lift the notices of disallowance.The COA Regional Office No. VIII issued a Decision[10] on July 14, 2015 denying the appeal for lack of merit. Petitioners subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal[11] on August 12, 2015 before the COA Proper. On December 28, 2017, the COA promulgated the assailed Decision denying the appeal for being filed out of time. The COA found that petitioners appealed to the COA Regional Office after 267 days had lapsed from their receipt of the NDs.[12] The COA noted that petitioners failed to explain why they did not file a timely appeal. At any rate, the COA ruled that the ECA and MAMA had no sufficient basis, hence, they were properly disallowed. The COA disposed:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Appeal, treated as a Petition for Review, is hereby DISMISSED for having been filed out of time. Accordingly, Commission on Audit Regional Office No. VIII Decision No. 2015-019 dated July 14, 2015, which affirmed Notice of Disallowance Nos. 14-001-101 (2012), 14-002-101 (2012), and 14-003-101 (2012), all dated February 20, 2014, on the payment of Economic Crisis Assistance and Monetary Augmentation of Municipal Agency to the job order, contractual, and permanent or regular personnel of the Municipal Government of Mondragon, Northern Samar; and some employees of national government agencies, in the amounts of P2,247,339.54 and P618,800.00, respectively, or in the aggregate amount of P2,886,139.54, is FINAL and EXECUTORY.[13]Their motion for reconsideration having been denied,[14] petitioners filed the instant petition.Petitioners invoke good faith in approving the disbursements for it has been customary for the municipality to grant ECA and MAMA to its employees, and they have never received any prior disallowance by the COA or the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).[15] They argue that a finding of illegality of the disbursements does not automatically mean that all of the approving officials failed to exercise ordinary diligence and should thereby be personally liable for the disallowed amounts.[16]Did the COA commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the appeal filed by petitioners and in upholding the notices of disallowances issued against the grant of the ECA and MAMA to municipal employees? Our RulingThe petition has partial merit.At the outset, the petition should have been dismissed outright for having been filed out of time. The COA correctly observed that petitioners had not only exhausted the period for filing an appeal but also failed to justify their noncompliance with the reglementary period.Indeed, the right to appeal is a statutory right and one who seeks to avail of the right must comply with the statute or rules. The rules, particularly the requirements for perfecting an appeal within the reglementary period specified in the law, must be strictly followed as they are considered indispensable interdictions against needless delays and for orderly discharge of judicial business.[17] The perfection of appeal in the manner and within the period set by law is not only mandatory but jurisdictional as well.[18]Nonetheless, the Court may set aside technicalities in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction in order to fully serve the demands of substantial justice.[19] It should be emphasized that the general rule remains that when the COA denies an appeal for being filed out of time, this Court shall not entertain the petition filed under Rule 64 to question the dismissal of the appeal by the COA. An exception is when extraordinary circumstances exist,[20] such as in this case, where the Court has decided a prior petition questioning the decision of the COA and the later petition is intertwined with it, provided that the latter is resolved in order to be consistent and in conformity with prevailing jurisprudence on disallowance cases, for instance, Madera v. Commission on Audit (Madera).[21]Notably, Madera involved the NDs issued by the COA against the Municipality of Mondragon, Northern Samar concerning different allowances authorized by separate resolutions and ordinances issued by the Sangguniang Bayan in December 2013. Similarly, aside from the ECA and MAMA which are the subject disallowances in the present petition, the COA disallowed the grant of Agricultural Crisis Assistance (ACA) and Mitigation Allowance to Municipal Employees (MAME) for being contrary to Sec. 12 of R.A. No. 6758, Item II of COA Circular No. 2013-003 dated January 30, 2013, and Items 4 and 5 of Sec. l(a) of COA Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002. The petitioners in Madera, as in this petition, raised the defense of good faith to absolve them from being liable for the disallowed amounts.Although the Court upheld the propriety of disallowing the amounts for lack of legal support, the petitioners in Madera were excused from returning the same on account of their good faith in certifying the availability of the funds and in approving the disbursements. In determining the liability of approving and certifying officers to return the disallowed amounts by the COA, the Court laid down the following rubrics:If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows: Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.Approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of  the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarity liable to return only the net disallowed amount which, x x x, excludes amounts excused under the following sections 2c and 2d.Recipients — whether approving or certifying officers or mere passive recipients — are liable to return the disallowed amounts respectively received by them, unless they are able to show that the amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered.The Court may likewise excuse the return of recipients based on undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other bona fide exceptions as it may determine on a case to case basis.[22]Applying the above standards, the Court noted the following circumstances which led to the conclusion that petitioners were in good faith while performing their functions in relation to the disallowed amounts:First, a review of the SB Resolutions and Ordinance used as basis for the grant of the subject allowances shows that these were primarily intended as financial assistance to municipal employees in view of the increase of cost on prime commodities, shortage of agricultural products, and the vulnerability of their municipality to calamities and disasters. Notably, these subject allowances were granted after the onslaught of typhoon Yolanda which greatly affected the Municipality. While noble intention is not enough to declare the allowances as valid, it nevertheless supports petitioners' claim of good faith. As held in Escarez v. COA:The grant of the FGI to petitioners has a lofty purpose behind it: the alleviation, to any extent possible, of the difficulty in keeping up with the rising cost of living. Indeed, under the circumstances, We find that the FGI was given and received in good faith. The NFA Council approved the grant under the belief, albeit mistaken, that the presidential issuances and the OGCC Opinion provided enough bases to support it; and the NFA officials and employees received the grant with utmost gratefulness.Second, that these additional allowances had been customarily granted over the years and there was no previous disallowance issued by the COA against these allowances further bolster petitioners' claim of good faith. Indeed, while it is true that this customary scheme does not ripen into valid allowances, it is equally true that in all those years that the additional allowances had been granted, the COA did not issue any ND against these grants, thereby leading petitioners to believe that these allowances were lawful.Notably, since the issuance of the NDs in 2014, the Municipality has stopped giving these allowances to their employees. However, this is not to say that the presumption of good faith would be ipso facto negated if the Municipality had otherwise continued to grant the allowances despite the issuance of NDs. After all, an ND is not immediately final as it may still be reversed by the COA or even the Court. Unless and until an ND becomes final, the continued grant of a benefit or allowance should not automatically destroy the presumption of good faith on the part of the approving/certifying officers, especially when there is sufficient or, at the very least, colorable legal basis for such grant.Third, petitioners relied on the Resolutions and Ordinance of the Sangguniang Bayan which have not been invalidated; hence, it was within their duty to execute these issuances in the absence of any contrary holding by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan or the COA. They were of the belief, albeit mistakenly, that these Resolutions and Ordinance were sufficient legal bases for the grant of the allowances especially since the LGC empowers the Sangguniang Bayan to approve ordinances and pass resolutions concerning allowances. Similar to the ruling in Veloso v. Commission on Audit where the Court accepted as a badge of good faith the fact that the questioned disbursements were made pursuant to ordinances, petitioners' reliance on the SB Resolutions and Ordinance should likewise be considered in their favor.As can be deduced above, petitioners disbursed the subject allowances in the honest belief that the amounts given were due to the recipients and the latter accepted the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such reward. Otherwise stated, and to borrow the language of Lumayna, these mistakes committed are not actionable, absent a clear showing that such actions were motivated by malice or gross negligence amounting to bad faith. There was no showing of some dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent, or ill will in the grant of these benefits. There was no fraud nor was there a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill will for ulterior purposes.Thus, petitioners-approving and certifying officers are shielded from civil liability for the disallowance under Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.As for the payees, the Court notes that the COA Proper already excused their return; hence, they no longer appealed. In any case, while they are ordinarily liable to return for having unduly received the amounts validly disallowed by the COA, the return was properly excused not because of their good faith but because it will cause undue prejudice to require them to return amounts that were given as financial assistance and meant to tide them over during a natural disaster.In view of the foregoing, the return is excused in its entirety in favor of all persons held liable in the ND.[23] (citations omitted)Herein petitioners' defense of good faith in certifying the availability of funds and approving the disbursements deserves the same treatment extended in Madera.Firstly, with the exception of petitioner Bugna, herein petitioners Mananguite, Galing and Pelo were made accountable by the COA by virtue of their certification and approval of the disallowed amounts. The Court notes that they were the same petitioners in Madera who were found to have acted in good faith when they performed their respective functions in relation to the prohibited allowances. In the absence of any evidence showing the contrary, the Court finds herein petitioners to have similarly acted in good faith when they issued their certifications and approval of the disallowed disbursements.Secondly, petitioners also relied on the resolutions and ordinance issued by the Sangguniang Bayan which had not been invalidated either by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan or the COA. Notable that the COA issued en masse the assailed NDs herein and those in Madera on February 20, 2014. As such, herein petitioners were unaware at the time they made their certifications and approvals that the ECA and MAMA are prohibited allowances. It was only in 2014, after receiving the NDs, that the local government of Mondragon stopped the grant of the disallowed ECA and MAMA.[24]Finally, the grant of the ECA and MAMA was intended as financial assistance to municipal employees to help lighten the financial burden of its employees.[25] This lofty purpose indicates that petitioners acted in good faith when they issued their certifications and approvals in releasing public funds to cover the ECA and MAMA.In the absence of evidence showing negligence and malice in certifying and approving the disallowed disbursements, herein petitioners are exempt from civil liability under Sec. 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987. Accordingly, they should not be liable to return the disallowed amounts.WHEREFORE, the Court PARTIALLY GRANTS the petition; and AFFIRMS with MODIFICATION the Commission on Audit Decision No. 2017-482 dated December 28, 2017 and Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2020-196 dated January 29, 2020 affirming the Notice of Disallowance Nos. 14-001-101(2012), 14-002-101(2012), and 14-003-101(2012) in the total amount of P2,866,139.54, but finds petitioners ABSOLVED from civil liability for the disallowed amount.SO ORDERED.Peralta, C.

      "Petitioners Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Employees Union (DENREU) and Kalipunan ng mga Kawani sa Kagawarang Kalikasan (K4) filed the present Petition for Injunction and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the constitutionality of Budget Circular No. 2011-5 dated December 26, 2011 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). The circular placed a P25,000.00 ceiling on the amount of the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive for 2011. In compliance therewith, respondent Commission on Audit (COA) disallowed the DENR's issuance of CNA Incentives to its officers and employees for exceeding said limit.The antecedent facts are as follows.On June 1, 1987, then President Corazon C. Aquino enacted Executive Order (EO) No. 180 which provided for guidelines on the exercise of government employees' right to organize and created a Public Sector Labor-Management Council (PSLMC) tasked to implement and administer the provisions thereof.Pursuant thereto, the PSLMC issued Resolution No. 4, series of 2002 on November 14, 2002, allowing the grant of the CNA incentive to National Government Agencies (NGAs), State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), and Local Government Units (LGUs) in recognition of the joint efforts of labor and management to achieve all planned targets which shall be taken from savings generated after the signing of the CNA that are no longer intended for specific purposes.Thereafter, on May 19, 2003, the PSLMC issued another Resolution No. 2, series of 2003 granting the CNA incentive, this time, to Government-owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) specifying additional guidelines in determining the amount of the CNA incentive.On September 28, 2004, the PSLMC next issued Resolution No. 2, series of 2004, adopting the \"Amended Rules and Regulations Governing the Exercise of the Right of Government Employees to Organize.\" It pertinently recognized the grant of the CNA incentive to government employees which may be the subject of negotiation between the management and the accredited employee's organization.On August 31, 2004, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 103 entitled \"Directing the Continued Adoption of Austerity Measures in the Government\" in order to meet the country's fiscal targets and maintain economic stability through various cost-cutting measures. Thus, all NGAs, SUCs, GOCCs, GFIs and other government Corporate Entities (OGCEs), whether exempt from Salary Standardization Law or not, were directed to suspend the grant of new or additional benefits to their officials and employees. However, the AO particularly exempted from said suspension CNA Incentives agreed to be given in strict compliance with the provisions of the PSLMC Resolutions No. 04, s. 2002 and No. 2, s. 2003.On December 27, 2005, President Arroyo issued AO No. 135 entitled \"Authorizing the Grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive to Employees in Government Agencies\" re-confirming the grant of the CNA incentive, pursuant to CNAs entered into on or after the effectivity of PSLMC Resolution No. 4, series of 2002, and PSLMC Resolution No. 2, series of 2003. It limited the grant to rank-and-file employees and precluded its duplication with incentives granted through the Program on Awards and Incentives for Service Excellence (PRAISE). In addition, it provided that the DBM shall issue the policy and procedural guidelines for the implementation thereof.Pursuant thereto, the DBM issued Budget Circular No. 2006-1 on February 1, 2006 prescribing the guidelines on the grant of CNA Incentives authorized under the PSLMC Resolutions, confirmed by AO No. 135.On November 26, 2010, petitioner Kalipunan ng mga Kawani sa Kagawaran ng Kalikasan (K4), the registered national union of the DENR rank-and-file employees, and the DENR, entered into a CNA.[1]On September 29, 2011, the DBM issued Circular Letter No. 2011-9 reminding all concerned that the CNA incentive shall be granted in accordance with the provision of Budget Circular No. 2006-1. It reiterated (1) the one-time grant of the incentive paid after the end of the year, provided that the planned targets have been completed; (2) the funding source of the incentive which is limited to savings generated from pre-identified expense accounts; and 3) the submission of reports to the DBM on the utilization of savings for the payment of the incentive.Shortly thereafter, on December 26, 2011, the DBM issued the assailed Budget Circular No. 2011-5 to prescribe supplemental guidelines on the grant of the CNA Incentive for the Fiscal Year 2011, in addition to Budget Circular No. 2006-1 and Circular Letter No. 2011-9, pursuant to Item (4)(h)(ii)(aa) of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution (JR) No. 4, series of 2009.[2] Particularly, the circular provided that \"the CNA incentive for FY 2011 shall be determined based on the amount of savings generated by an agency following the guidelines herein, but not to exceed P25,000.00 per qualified employee.\" It, likewise, provided that it shall take effect immediately.[3]Consequently, the COA issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 12-002-101 (11)[4] dated May 22, 2012 with respect to the CNA Incentives granted by the DENR to its officers and employees for CY 2011 totaling P31,275,975.00. It disallowed the amount of P14,983,500.40 for being in excess of the P25,000.00 limit per qualified employee as provided in Section 3.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2011-5. As such, the COA directed the concerned employees to return the excess.On December 21, 2012, petitioner DENREU filed an Appeal Memorandum before the COA seeking a reconsideration of ND No. 12-002-101 (11). In its September 11, 2015 Decision, however, the COA dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time or beyond the six (6)-month reglementary period from receipt of the ND as allowed under the Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA. Then, on December 21, 2017, the COA issued a Notice of Finality of Decision ordering the named persons liable to pay their shares of the disallowed amount to the agency cashier and authorizing said cashier to withhold payment of their salaries in the event of their failure to pay. Subsequently, the COA issued an Order of Execution dated January 11, 2018 instructing the DENR to withhold payment of salaries or any amount due the concerned employees to settle their liabilities subject of the disallowance.A month prior to their appeal to the COA or on November 20, 2012, petitioners filed the instant petition essentially raising the following issue:I.WHETHER OR NOT DBM BUDGET CIRCULAR NO. 2011-5 DATED DECEMBER 26, 2011 IS CONSTITUTIONAL, AND THUS, VALID AND BINDING FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2011.Petitioners raise infirmities attendant in the issuance of DBM Budget Circular No. 2011-5 rendering it unconstitutional, specifically the circular's lack of prior publication in the Official Gazette or newspaper of general circulation, required by law and jurisprudence of administrative regulations as a condition for their effectivity. Petitioners maintain that the circular, issued on December 26, 2011, cannot be permitted to impose restrictions on the grant of CNA Incentives for the same fiscal year 2011 without the requisite publication. They highlight the fact that the circular was received by the DENR only on December 29, 2011, which was the last official day for the calendar year 2011, at a time when negotiations on the CNA Incentive between the DENR management and the union had already concluded.Moreover, petitioners assert their vested right to the incentive which was simply dependent on the savings generated by the agency for the year without the P25,000.00 limitation imposed by the circular. To require them to refund the amount they received in good faith would cause them grave injustice and irreparable injury that the Court must prevent through the grant of an injunction restraining respondent from implementing its circular.In his Comment, respondent Secretary Florencio B. Abad of the DBM questions the remedy of prohibition used by petitioners, for the assailed circular was issued in his exercise of quasi-legislative powers. He also alleges that there can be no vested right to the CNA incentive for one's right to the same becomes enforceable only upon compliance with the conditions set forth by law and issuances.Secretary Abad cites the ruling in Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) v. COA,[5] wherein the validity of DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-1 was upheld for being germane to the purposes of AO No. 135 and PSLMC Resolution No. 2 to ensure that the CNA incentive be funded by savings generated from cost-reducing measures and no other. Since the assailed DBM Budget Circular No. 2011-5 similarly seeks to ensure that the government programs are not hampered by the tendency of agencies to scrimp on vital expenditures or bloating their budgets to accumulate savings for the CNA incentive, a benefit which petitioners have no vested right to, said circular must also be upheld. Moreover, this Court, in MIAA v. COA,[6] had already affirmed the authority of the DBM to issue rules and regulations in the grant of CNA Incentives. Furthermore, Secretary Abad adds that petitioners' failure to comply with the condition imposed by DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-1 requiring that the incentive be paid only after the end of the year constitutes a violation thereof making the grant of the incentive unlawful.As to the publication requirement, Secretary Abad counters that the DENR admittedly received a copy of the assailed circular before the end of FY 2001 or on December 29, 2011. Had they followed the mandate of DBM Budget Circular No. 2011-5 on payment of the incentive after the end of the year, they would have considered the P25,000.00 cap imposed by the assailed circular. Thus, they cannot now challenge the validity of DBM Budget Circular No. 2011-5 for they were given due notice of the same on December 29, 2011. Moreover, he adds that, at any rate, the subject circular was, in fact, published in the Philippine Star, a newspaper of general circulation, as evidenced by the certification[7] attached in his Comment.The petition is granted in part.At the outset, the Court takes notice of the fact that the COA had already issued Notices of Finality of Decision and the corresponding Orders of Execution as a result of the dismissal of petitioners' appeal for being filed beyond the six (6)-month reglementary period. As a general rule, the perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, and the failure to perfect the appeal renders the judgment of the court final and executory. As such, it has been held that the availability of an appeal is fatal to a special civil action for certiorari, for the same is not a substitute for a lost appeal.[8]But while it is doctrinally entrenched that certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal, the Court has allowed the resort to a petition for certiorari despite the existence of or prior availability of an appeal, such as: (1) where the appeal does not constitute a speedy and adequate remedy; (2) where the orders were also issued either in excess of or without jurisdiction; (3) for certain special considerations, as public welfare or public policy; (4) where in criminal actions, the court rejects rebuttal evidence for the prosecution as, in case of acquittal, there could be no remedy; (5) where the order is a patent nullity; and (6) where the decision in the certiorari case will avoid future litigations.[9]We find the present case to fall under the exception rather than the general rule. As will be discussed below, there exists urgent, meritorious considerations which the Court must pass upon lest there be an unwarranted denial of justice. We have recently ruled in Confederation for Unity, Recognition and Advancement of Government Employees (COURAGE), et. al. v. Abad,[10] that the challenged Budget Circular No. 2011-5 affects all government employees with existing valid CNAs allowing the grant of CNA Incentives. Since there are no facts, moreover, that would necessitate burdening the Court with the task of exhaustive examination of evidentiary matters, We shall consider the merits of the present case in the interest of judicial economy and to prevent further delay in its disposition.On the procedural issue of the propriety of petitioners' chosen action for prohibition, the Court has recently made certain clarifications insofar as judicial power is concerned. It is true that under Rule 65[11] of the Rules of Court, a petition for certiorari and prohibition corrects errors of jurisdiction committed by any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. It is also true that the subject Budget Circular No. 2011-5 was issued in the DBM Secretary's rule-making or quasi-legislative functions. But We have had several occasions where We found the Court's judicial power under Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution[12] to be broad enough to include the determination of whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government even in their exercise of legislative and quasi-legislative functions.As enunciated in Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison v. De Lima:[13]True, a petition for certiorari and prohibition is not an appropriate remedy to assail the validity of the subject IRR as it was issued in the exercise of respondents' rule-making or quasi-legislative function. Nevertheless, the Court has consistently held that \"petitions for certiorari and prohibition are appropriate remedies to raise constitutional issues and to review, prohibit or nullify the acts of legislative and executive officials.\" In Araullo v. Aquino III, former Associate Justice, now Chief Justice, Lucas P. Bersamin, explained the remedies of certiorari and prohibition, thus:x x x xWith respect to the Court, however, the remedies of certiorari and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of certiorari or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but also to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. This application is expressly authorized by the text of the second paragraph of Section 1, supra.Thus, petitions for certiorari and prohibition are appropriate remedies to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify the acts of legislative and executive officials.Necessarily, in discharging its duty under Section 1, supra, to set right and undo any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, the Court is not at all precluded from making the inquiry provided the challenge was properly brought by interested or affected parties. The Court has been thereby entrusted expressly or by necessary implication with both the duty and the obligation of determining, in appropriate cases, the validity of any assailed legislative or executive action. This entrustment is consistent with the republican system of checks and balances.[14]In cases, therefore, where proper, interested parties seek to assail alleged unconstitutional acts of legislative and executive officials committed with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, the Court shall not refrain from performing its judicial duty to determine the validity of the assailed action. In this case, the issue set forth by petitioners is precisely whether Secretary Abad gravely abused his discretion in issuing the assailed DBM Budget Circular No. 2011-5.It must be remembered, though, that no question involving the constitutionality or validity of a law or governmental act may be heard and decided unless the following requisites for judicial inquiry are present: (a) there must be an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power; (b) the person challenging the act must have the standing to question the validity of the subject act or issuance; (c) the question of constitut\n",
